  "acura_ilx_2016": " Wanted to stay with Honda products, having been an owner of Honda or Acura since 1980.  Like the exterior styling of this car very much.  However, I have a spine condition and find the buckets are too deep and make my back hurt after 30 minutes.  Hate the hesitation with acceleration , feel like I'm driving a tank, but need to make allowances here since I am coming for a car that has 260 hp.  Wish I had gone for the Navi on upper level package because there is a stupid black screen behind the clock that is distracting.  The cabin feels claustrophobic and small.  The seating adjustments are not enough.  I'm trying to find a seat cushion to fix the bucket issue, but everything pushes my head into the headliner.  I've had this car for 3.5 weeks and am counting the days until I can sell it , get something else.  I've sat in every Honda and Acura product and only found 3 seats that were comfortable for my back...Honda Fit , HR-V, and Acura TLX.  Latter is too big and hated the push buttons (had those on my teenage car and not going back!), car also too big.  Fit is OK, but feels like I'm downgrading from old Acura.  HR-V was OK, but don't want an SUV.  Finishes on interiors of Honda , Acura products really cheaped out now.  Still looking for something to replace this Acura ILX.  SOOOOO very disappointed in Honda/Acura now.  Feeling really let down by this manufacturer.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " My 2nd Acura to date and just like the previous one, it's been great. Excellent highway mileage of 39 mi/gallon and is not a slouch if you want speed. The car handle really well around corners and have a very good braking system. We currently have 6 Honda made products 2 Civic (2005 and 2007), 2 CRV (2009 and 2013), the Ilx, and a lawn mower and all have been super reliable. I place reliability above anything else and my experience with Honda cars have been excellent. Both Civicc and the 2009 CRV have way over 100k miles and not one ever had a single problem. I don't expect less from a Honda built automobile and I don't expect less from the Acura either.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " **NOTE**  ILX not TLX -- I liked everything about this car except for a few items -. Hate the speech recognition system: doesn't recognize my commands, very inflexible command structure,. Cabin noise is to high with the premium tires, the navigation system is not compressive with current systems., even, no speed limit indication, messy to input destinations and 2nd waypoints. The good thing is Siri works well and does understand voice commands. Likes: snappy, 8 speed transmission is outstanding, Best reason to own are the electronic safety controls.  These take about 50% of the effort out of long distance driving.  Also getting 39 mpg on highway trips. Low roof for tall people",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This car is great! The ride is snug and very quiet. The only major complaint is storage space within car. My last acura, i had storage in the middle compartment, doors, and behind seats. It doesn't have an overhead storage for glasses either. Besides those minor challenges, the car handles great, i haven't really openned it up, i just reached 1500 miles on it. I am happy with the car, acura makes very good products, look forward to enjoy car for a long time",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " We were searching for a good lease rate and reliable vehicle that was stylish and had good ratings.  This car has a sports car feel, fun to drive, and handles beautifully (except for a small turning radius)!  The stripped down version gets you a sunroof, backup camera, and very nice front seat, all safety features, great Bluetooth,  all for less than many non-luxury compacts, including the Civic, which has higher lease costs and less features for the price.  Well worth our investment!!",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This is my 3rd Honda and my 2nd Acura. After 300K+ miles and 11 years, I gave my old 2004 TSX to my son who is still driving it. I decided to lease a new 2016 ILX after Acura did the redesign of the exterior and put back the peppy and quick VR4 that was in my TSX. On the plus side, the car is just like the TSX: great handling, terrific on corners and curves, super reliable, solid feel, awesome braking, beautiful long drive on the road touring vehicle, takes 5 passengers around town comfortably with room for luggage, and gets lots of compliments on the styling and interior design. Gas mileage is okay - but not the 29 mpg average promised. Only getting 27 consistently when 1-2 passengers, much less with a full car. On the minus side, I wish the car was like the TSX: the dual screen technology seems redundant and is very distracting compared to the single touch screen the TSX had, the acceleration is hesitant - the car seems to 'think' about moving faster before it actually goes into gears. Gas mileage sucks in city driving. Freeway is 31mpg only, not the 35mpg promised. UPDATE after 1 Year: Exterior pain gets stained easily. Design flaw. Looks like the clear coat is easily damaged by on road flying liquids. OVERALL: Great car, just wish Honda/Acura had not removed the 'fun' and 'simple' aspect of the TSX. Sadly, sometimes I want to take back my old TSX from my son and give him the ILX....",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " Like other Hondas I have owned in the past, this 2016 ILX has been flawless. It doesn't drive like a BMW or Audi, but it handles very well and the ride is good, except on rough pavement. I love all of the tech gadgets and the sound system is good. I live in the city, but most of my work commute is on the highway.  I am a stickler for gas mileage and this car does not disappoint. It routinely gets over 40 mpg on the highway, averages 37 in mixed driving, and has never clocked less than 34 mpg on a tank of gas. I run it with regular gas and have seen no difference in performance compared to premium.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " Have own the fully loaded Tech plus A-SPEC ILX with the bigger 18",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " Just traded my 2016 RDX Base for the 2016 ILX Premium.  Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it's loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn't as luxurious and doesn't perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can't ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can't have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.  The Premium with Blind Spot, cross traffic alert, real Milano leather, and the two tier screen system are worth every penny.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.  You have to read between the lines.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I absolutely adore this car. I have no idea what some people are talking about regarding the seats being uncomfortable. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever driven in. This car is just what I was looking for...a beautiful, reliable and luxurious commuter. The white model really turns heads and by the first week I'd already gotten so many compliments. Interior road noise is perfect, road feel is excellent, steering is excellent, ever little detail in his car screams luxury. Really nothing bad I can say about this car, and no I've not been paid to say these things...this car is just that good.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " Ok....so after driving my Mini Cooper hardtop and commuting 70 miles a day 6 days a week I decided it was time to trade in the stick shift and grow up. After looking at all the entry level luxury vehicles, I decided on the Acura ILX. My situation is, I wanted economical luxury. I wanted a car I could drive until the wheels fell off. I wanted a car that I didn't have to make difficult appointments for to get serviced or maintained. I didn't want to worry about what service needed to be done when the service due light came on....a burden I had driving the mini. For me, this car works great! I bought the premium package in black right around when they launched the 2016's... Drove it for a year and realized I had made a huge mistake. Black is a horrible color to keep clean when you commute and don't park in a garage! So when I took my car in today for its second ever service, I was somehow made an offer I couldn't refuse on a brand new white premium with ASPEC. There is a major difference between the two. I love the ASPEC seats and odometer and foot pedals. The front looks less like a beak! I'm so glad I upgraded! Maintence is painless and affordable! No stress car for younger commuter! I'm happy!",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I was looking forward to driving this car because I liked the styling and have owned two Acura TL's. After owning 10 Honda's also , I thought I'd check it outThe car has a nice cockpit but no lumbar support or adjustment so it was out for me with back issues. It is laid out nicely but storage is the least I've seen in any other car. console compartment is small and cheap feeling and the door storage can fit a tennis ball??My main compmaint is a general one with the CVT transmission on ANY car. It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse Over al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars. I just want to actually enjoy the driving experience. Acura is only better than Honda of you can spend over $30K. The Civic is a superior car to the ILX and less expensive. Back to Honda or maybe Subaru",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This is a great car in the sporty entry luxury space. The engine and transmission pairing are strong and energetic. The technology package adds great safety and convenience features.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I bought this car because after test driving it reminded me of my '07 Civic Si, which I sold to go back to school, only a bit more refined. However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. I'll start with the positives: The engine is good it's a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it's working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it's an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.Now to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver's seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don't like to crank lumbar up to 11, you're not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you're going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there's the fact that in the best position I've found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.The rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here's the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling leather wrap on the steering wheel stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)' phone call quality ease of using phone controlsxe2x80xa6pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it's made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. So you might think that if you don't care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren't for the issue with the driver's seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I got my car back in April of 2015. Reason I took off one star is squeaky front brakes issue.  It's factory defect and acura is aware of it (Please google on tgat issue if you are interested). Acura did not want to change my brakes at time I came in and I don't have any more time to waste with them so I live with it.  It's a huge disappointed  especially for a brand such as acura. Another star I taken off because I believe few other things could have been better.  Such as,  very rough ride over uneven pavement and especially potholes. No 40/60 rear fold,  whole rear seat just folds.  Steering is a little numb as well. Not too much headroom for tall drivers. Never the less its an enormous value. For $27k you get compact (a plus for some)  0-60 in less than 7 seconds,  great fuel economy,  decent handling,  sunroof,  keyless entery,  duel clutch transmission,  full Led head lights,  Adaptive cruise,  crush prevention system, auto dual climate, heated seats and mirrors,  back up cam,   Acura badge (Might matter to some.",

  "acura_ilx_2016": " I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!PRO:($30,000 out the door)This is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  CON:If you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like ",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I got the Premium pkg. This car handles really well. Great pickup, very stable, breaks nicely, feels solid and safe. I am ver happy with the great mileage. The interior is nice and roomy. My husband and son in law, who are tall fit fine, no complaints. Great looker, I love this car. The Navi I'm not too crazy about, but I just use my iPhone for me, the rest of the great pros override this one feature.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " If you're in the market for an entry level luxury sedan, you're most likely considering the Audi A3, MB CLA or the BMW 320, along with the ILX. Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.Considering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I came from a manual stick shift 2003 Acura RSX Type S. I love that car and the only reason why I stick with Acura. I need a small compact 4 doors vehicle since I'm a family man with two kids. I looked at the Civics, the Accords. But they just blah and not exciting in terms of styling. Plus. I didn't want to be like 80% of the car out there on the road, so many of them. From teeny boppers, grandma's, Grandpa, to your soccer moms. No thanks. So there it is, I got the 2016 Acura ILX with premium/Aspec package. Honestly, its not really an upgrade from my RSX. Everything about this car feel cheap and could be better. Feels like they are rushing it. The gears always shifting. It can never stay in one gear long, it always shift to make sure the gears are highest fuel economy at the current speed. It's good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration. Coming from a cable, maybe it have to do with the new electric drive by wire, who knows but its really annoying when you need that quick acceleration. Now on the other hand, the Dual Clutch mode is awesome, stellar and works perfectly. I think that pretty much the only part of the car that stands out. Very responsive, smooth gear transition from downshift and up shift. The steering is numb and you don't feel that much road feed back. The handling is good. Not much body roll. The car puts me to sleep. I need some excitement, the thrill of a screaming VTEC kicking in. Instead I got a very boring tone. The seat doesnt have much bolster to snug you in. I feel Acura lost touch with its racing heritage. My other pet peeve is the head room, I'm 5'11",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and ",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I use this car almost exclusively for commuting, about 20 miles each way. It's a good solid car with great value. Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.Pros:Great value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.Cons:Transmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " This is my first Acura and generally I am very happy.  I haven't had it in for the first service yet but wanted to know if anyone is having issues with the infotainment system.  About once a week when I start the car the radio stations will come up with all the programmed numbers wrong.  The stations are correct if you select them but the numbers displayed are wrong.  Sometimes it will correct itself after a while and sometimes it won't.  Twice the backup camera has not gone off when I shift out of reverse and the upper display stays on the back up camera the entire time I am driving.  Next time I start it will go back to normal.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": " I ended up trading in my 2016 Acura ILX after owning it for only 3 months.  There was a brake defect where the brakes kept squeaking and after the rotors were replaced once and pads twice, the issue came back.  I think a recall will come at some point, but I was not going to wait because I was very disappointed.  The other Acura's I have owned have been great, I was very surprised that this car was released with this issue.  I traded it for a Mazda CX-3 and it is more fun to drive and and feels more powerful then the Acura.   The other issue with the Acura I noticed was the engine hum, it actually bothered my ears when I had the windows open.  The 2014 Acura ILX I had I liked better overall after owning this one for 3 months.  Before purchasing ask the dealership to give you one of their loaner cars that has a few miles on it and make sure you like driving it in everyday driving.  I would recommend buying a used 2013-2015 ILX instead.  Or a Mazda 3, I think the Mazda 3 GT would be more fun to drive everyday than the Acura.",

Performance is up due to the new engine but the old one was efficient and peppy. Good ride quality and very good value in the entry level luxury class. Compare to A3, CLA feature for feature and you'll see what I mean.",
  "acura_ilx_2016": "New jewel-eye LED headlights look great and add an uplevel look.  LED tailights as well.rnLike the addition of the memory driver's seat and the dual tech screens.  Acura Premium sound is great. Addition of the Blind Spot and Cross-traffic alerts is very helpful.",

  "acura_ilx_2017": " Feels like Honda literally sent Acura a civic LX and they ",
  "acura_ilx_2017": " Overall extremely pleased with my new ILX. The vehicle is attractive to the eye with quality panel fit and finish and a stunning paint job. The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle.",

Had driven only around 9500 miles when this problem started. Dealership replaced the transmission, but then also changed the radiator and the starter (since those also apparently had issues !) - all this took almost a month. In short, major components were bad/poor quality (?) in a brand new car - only major remaining part to replace is the engine !!! After the repairs, car still gives slight jerk during gear shifts. Dealership and Corporate customer service response was - slight jerk is normal for MDX. So buyers beware - from personal experience it seems Honda quality is not transferred to its luxury brand !!! Consider alternatives , do your research before spending your dollars....",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " After owning 5 Accords, 2 Odysseys, 1 CRV and a Pilot without any issues, I figured the next logical step was Acura. We test drove and almost bought a Ford Explorer Sport, but the Honda loyalist inside of me said the Acura would be a better overall purchase. From the moment we leased this MDX 6 months ago it has been a HUGE let down. The transmission is horrible and shifts almost violently (dealer said this is normal), the suspension pops and clunks on every bump (3 attempts by dealer to fix), the touch screen is cool in theory, but when you just want to turn on the seat heater or adjust the fan it takes far too much effort.  The cargo area is poorly designed (in my opinion) because the roof slopes in the rear and limits capacity. The seats seem to be okay they are a little small for my 6'3",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " I've driven the Acura MDX model since it arrived in 2001 and been an Acura owner since 1995. This being my 4th MDX the 2016 is the best driving experience I've ever had. I was a little nervous with the move to a crossover design, happy with the feel of the RL I've missed. The slight one inch lowering to the ground was a concern but still keeps me high enough on the road to see ahead in traffic. The new safety innovations are incredible and give me a new sense of road safety beyond what I've ever experienced. The gas mileage is through the roof beyond what I expected which was my main motivation for buying in May of 2016. I don't get all the transmission complaints, but I must say, I don't drive the car fast, I drive it economically for safety and good gas mileage. For this reason, the car is a dream. If you want a sports car, then go buy one. I love having the option of the engine stopping if you press the brake a tad harder at a stop. At first this was strange, but now a natural part of driving the car. All the technology took a small learning curve but once you learn, it's part of you. My Acura dealership has been completely responsive with any questions I have. The MDX handles beautifully with new smart technology helping to keep me in my lane when driving the freeway. I love the distance setting of three choices when using cruise. I'm not trying to out drive anyone, just selecting my space on the freeway to drive most economically. Hitting 28 miles to the gallon on a long trip is the best MPG I've ever received from any Acura. The sound system and tech package is delivers all I need and then some.

  "acura_mdx_2016": " This car has all of the creature comforts.   Good handling, comfortable interior, quiet on the inside, great gas mileage for an SUV.   None of those things matter, because these vehicles have BAD TRANSMISSIONS!    Have you ever been in a car with someone who is learning to drive a stick shift?   That's the way this car shifts in low gears.  It bucks, snorts, hesitates, and can't decide what gear to be in.  If you are coasting down a hill, it surges and accelerates.  Driving in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic was like wrestling a bear.  More than once I thought I had been rear-ended in slow moving traffic.....nope, just the car shifting.   I had the car back to the dealership 4 times.  They couldn't get their stories straight.   The Salesman told me it could not possibly be doing what I described and dismissed me.  The Service Manager said ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " Overall, the car rides comfortably and reliably, handles well in all weather conditions. My only two complaints: the transmission is a bit sluggish (took it in and they did an update, but don't really notice a difference) and the GPS is absolutely horrible. I am very disappointed that, after spending $50k on a brand new car - a car where, btw, the GPS is not standard (included in the technology package, which I have) - the GPS is utterly substandard. Not only is it slow, it takes 5 minutes to enter in an address, and half the time it is just plain WRONG. Very frustrating. I have to use my Garmin because it is so worthless.

It just doesn't stay up if you roll it down. It takes about 4-5 tries. The USB ports don't work. They said it's my phone, I have had 6 chargers and a new phone since my purchase. The computer/transmission has been in 3 times. They claimed it was a computer issue with shifting. However when my car failed to go over 30 MPH. I called, their response was there is no engine light on, there is no problem. However after my car being there for a week, they called to let me know the transmission is faulty and needs to be replaced. I called my sales rep (who we've used for 5 cars) to see if he could swap my car out for a similar one. He didn't help and told me to call Acura and file a complaint. He also said they will not do anything to help you. Extremely disappointed after spending 50k on a lemon. I did plan on purchasing this car at the end of the lease.",

My experience with my new Acura MDX is pretty bad so far.On June 20th, I had the first experience of the problem with dashboard showing that there is Transmission, Emission, and all other system problem. The car stopped on the road. Later it started but continue to flash the warnings.This same problem occurred second time on September 6th and at the time, I was starting the car and it won't even start. Later it started but continue to flash the warnings. I took the car to Acura dealership on these both occasions and it shows up later.Again, Third time it happened on October 30th.

Unfortunately, my dealership didn't apply the update, BUT next time my car is in for service, I will DEMAND they fix it, because I too, experience rough shifting, surges while braking and going downhill, and poor overall transmission performance.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE ON THE TRANSMISSION.  ACURA, ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?  Acura should be embarrassed to turn away customers.  No wonder they are LAST in customer satisfaction.  Now...onto the car.  Two major issues with this car: the transmission, and the infotainment system. The interior is nice size and comfortable, even though it doesn't feel so luxurious.  Handling is great, ride is smooth when the transmission isn't jerking you all over the place.  The overall infotainment system, navigation included, is SO slow and my 2008 Infiniti G35 had a better nav system.  It's pretty pathetic.

The navigation system and voice recognition system is really a joke as well. I replaced it with a dash-mounted iPhone. The car does handle well and the all-wheel drive is great.",

I am a little annoyed by the dull hum when you turn the steering wheel.  The service guy says that is how it is made.  I did not hear it in the other vehicles.  The controls screen HAVE to be UPDATED to include a single button to change air circulation, when you see some exhaust and dusts you have to scramble to find the control and press TWO BUTTONS to change to recycle.

  "acura_mdx_2016": " I thought many times before writing this review. I felt that there was no need to let others know about my problems , but my conscience just kept telling me to share my thoughts with the media. When I was driving home the first time from the showroom there was a metal knocking noise under vehicle and was quite concerned. I immediately called my salesman who put me through to service.the manager said there is a bulletin on this but acura had no fix ,but are working on one. i asked how long? and he responded by saying they have been working on it since 2014.I laughed and then choked and said what are you talking about. He said the design of the parking brake cable was not designed correctly and it knocks like a chain hitting the bottom. after quite a few adjustments and the rear brakes overheated from  overtightening the cable, I just gave up and  said I will live with it until acura comes up with a fix. Well, to continue, Ive had countless parking sensor issues that just go off even if no one is around waiting for the red light to change. It sometimes scares me thinking another vehicle is approaching .The only way to shut the sensors off is to override them and shut the system off completely. they removed my bumper 6 times ( damaging the bumper)and replaced modules and sensors and harness and still no fix.The dealers remedy is to just shut them off permanently, even though i bought the advance model to get this option factory installed.My preset steering wheel only works sometimes. My 9 speed tranny clanks ,I guess it wants to let me know its still there . My brakes practically go down to the floor and acura tells me that its ok. Seat adjustments are not great,but i guess acceptable. My rear backup camera looks like I have been driving in a dense fog ( useless) .They say other mdx cameras look similar. The ride quality on smooth roads is fine ,but try hitting a few minor potholes and it goes right through the cabin. While I was even servicing the vehicle a woman was complaining about the terrible ride quality and vowed to sell her mdx just to keep her sanity. There is a scraping noise when you first start the suv in the morning. Might I have to say more. Acura customer relations keeps telling me that they would like to continue working with me to correct these issues after more then 5 attempts ( i stopped counting) and yes I am aware of the lemon law.I said the right thing is to put me in another vehicle and you can continue to correcting these issues on your own and spend 24 hours a day to figure it out so other loyal customers don't suffer. Acura ,unfortunately with being the best selling luxury suv cannot get it right. i guess people gravitate to it because the price is great compared to other similar suvs .Also, acura shares the same mother company as the civic and accord who have held top honors for many year, so people that want luxury and reliability will hopefully get it like the honda products previously mentioned.I am not writing to punish acura  I just want them to get it right. In closing, Maybe I just might just decide to stop punishing myself one day and move on to another brand after owning acura's for many years. I guess Im finally getting wise that taking off a shield on the front grill or giving real wood trim instead of plastic will ultimately not shield this company from customers realizing that there is something wrong here. What acura needs to do instead of fixing a grill issue is to fix mechanical issues that are the real reason why people have always purchased honda products in the first place called reliability.",

I tried to restart the engine and when it did, it move very slow and roughly to the shoulder of the freeway. After restarting the engine, ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS  came ON including Break System Failure or Malfunction. It scared my whole family and it was the most horrible UNSAFE DRIVE HOME for hours worrying if we still have break system working. Dropped of the MDX at our local dealership and until now (about 9 days now) still trying to figure  things out.. We feel like this vehicle is just so UNSAFE now and it basically traumatized my whole family being in this MDX.  Will review lemon law and make sure we don't become the CRASH TEST DUMMIES for this. And I hate hearing them say ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " I traded my 2013 Acura MDM in for a 2016 and am very disappointed in the new car's transmission.  It is very clunky and shifts in and out of gears unnecessarily.  Based on the transmission alone, I would not recommend this vehicle.  The old transmission was a 6 speed and was much smoother than the current 9 speed.  At highway speeds it is fine, but in ordinary city stop/go traffic it is not.  I do like the lane change warnings and the warnings that you get when you are backing up that another car is approaching from the sides.  This is very helpful when pulling out of a parking space when another truck or SUV is next to you.  The car informs you someone is coming before you can actually see the oncoming car.  Very nice feature!  I wish Acura would offer a HUD, I have one on a BMW and it is another feature that once you have, you don't ever want to give up.  The navigation system display is not very well done and the software it uses is not very efficient, also much better on my BMW.  All-in-all, I would rather have my old MDX back.",

I ghad a BMW which I loved, but it had 190,000 miles on it and I wanted dependable transportation for traveling now this is what I am stuck with.  I will say the people at the Acura dealer were very nice, but I did not get great end results.  When you spend that kind of money and this happens they should make it right.",

So when the 2017 Acura hit the showroom last week, I was pretty sure I would end up buying another one.  It's not going to happen.  Took it for a test ride and noticed immediately how differently it shifted when accelerating onto a highway.   Couldn't get out of its own way--that's the way it feels anyway.  Back in the showroom the salesperson told me they changed the gears from 6 to 9 back in 2016.  I have no idea what that means I only know that the car doesn't feel right going through NINE gears.  Like I'm towing a boat or something.  It has the power it just takes too long to get to it.  What a shame--just when they finally changed the front grill.",

Given my happiness with Honda vehicles, I always assumed it would be an Acura MDX. After taking it for a test drive I have nothing really bad to say about the vehicle, only that it looked and drove like a very, very nice Honda, but not what anyone would consider a luxury vehicle. It lacked the plusher interior as well as the driving enjoyment that one would expect from a luxury car (at what what still a luxury price). As a matter of fact, I also test drove a completely decked out 2016 Honda Pilot Elite and found that other than being even bigger tan the Acura offered similar features at a lower price.",

I'm amazed at the transformation, I'd been driving my MDX with 180K miles. Having also been an RL owner, I now feel I have the best of both vehicles in one. The slightly lowered height from the road is just perfect! The few lower reviews of the entertainment system has not been a problem for me. There's a lot to digest with so many great features, I take each feature one at a time which for me has been an enjoyable easy process. I love the new touch gear shifting! I love the sportier drive for an SUV, it really does not feel like I'm driving an SUV. The gas mileage increase is sweet, which is one reason I waited so long to buy a 2016. Love the seat air ventilation system that keeps me from back sweating during hot summer months. I can now seamlessly play music from my iPhone. The biggest surprise and enjoy is the warning system and lane keeping assist system. I feel like I'm now protected from blind spots when changing lanes and drifting out of my lane. This is simply the best vehicle I have ever owned! A huge leap of comfort, safety and technology in the past 10 years!

Had a transmission issue the first day I drive the car.  Transmission got stuck in low gear.  Was solved with a software upgrade and been ok so far.  I did a lot of research on the transmission issues and was under the impression that the ills of 2015 were fixed in 2016.  Not sure of that.  Next issue was a rattle from the rear of the car since day 1.  Turns out that a bolt was dropped into the chassis during assembly which required taking out part of the interior to find.  How did that ever pass the quality check before delivery I don't know.  On a positive note, I am actually getting great mileage - averaging 25 mpg on the freeways, far better than my last Lexus.  But the car feels cheap and as if corners were cut.  Lots of plastic and poor damping on the different cubbies in the car.  My Lexus was far superior for only about $3k more.

I obviously should have test driven the same vehicle multiple times before purchasing it because after about three days I noticed the occasional awkward shifting.  I just told myself it's a brand new car and needs to adjust on its own. I feel like it did get better after a few months - or I just got used to the awkwardness. Sport mode was not even an option as it was super jerky and completely annoying.  At 6,800 miles it suddenly started making a high-pitched chirping noise when shifting into second gear, almost like the sound of tires screeching when peeling out. I immediately drove it to the dealership and the technician confirmed the issue. The next day they called and said the transmission needed to be replaced.  What!? I've owned several Hondas over the years and never had major issues. I thought I could trust Acura for their reliability record, but apparently not.

  "acura_mdx_2016": " We just picked this up last week without even having the intention of buying an Acura.  We originally looked hard into the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilots but realized the lease incentives were absolutely horrible due to the demand of both of those (we are in a spot in our lives where leasing makes more sense).  We started to look into non-3rd row options since our youngest is 2 and we have another one on the way in June, and we could go for a 3rd row when they got older. So I noticed a lease deal on an Acura RDX and wanted to investigate since we didn't like the RAV4 and CR-V options.  The RDX drove well but was too small.  The salesperson told me about a lease deal on a base MDX so we test drove it and LOVED IT.  The features are the same and the quality is better than the higher trim Highlander and Pilots and the lease payment was cheaper per month.  It has heated seats, leather, moonroof, backup camera, dual cabin screens, a 3rd row, jewel eye LED headlights, among other options.My wife has been driving is most of the time but so far we love it.  Definitely give it a shot if you're open to lease and are considering Toyota/Honda 3rd rows - you'd be surprised on payments.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " This is our first Acura. Although it has only been a month, this car has been a pleasure to drive. No vibrations or problems with shifting as mentioned in other reviews.

On the way up we got 24 mpg and on the way home to San Diego, 28 mpg, thanks to a nine speed transmission and half the cylinders shutting down on cruise control!  It is unbelievable how well this works with 290 hp to boot.  Consumer reports rated this vehicle an 89 rating, tops in the luxury mid size SUV category.

  "acura_mdx_2016": " I had also recently purchased the MDX and had the same vibrations as the previous post.  The story is the same - changed wheels, changed rotors, then balanced the tires.

Both Acura and dealership say this is normal variation of the MDX, and the lemon law does not apply since ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " Very disappointed, follow up to my previous post, ok my car has been at the dealers 6 times now for a vibration between 55 to 75 MPH 4,900 miles they keep saying they have to confirm the vibration which I have a service order from October stating they confirmed the vibration, they replaced the brake rotors, needless to say vibration still there, they replaced the tires, vibration still there, took it back to the dealer today for 6th time, another test drive with the service manager he said he could feel something but wasn't sure what it was, back seat was vibrating extensively, service manager acknowledged it, said he would take a new MDX off the lot drive it same route we drove mine to see if the road made it vibrate. They called and said they test drove a new MDX off the lot and it vibrates worse than mine so it's a characteristic of the vehicle. They actually put this in writing on the service order. I asked if they were informing consumers of this vibration characteristic when they were looking at the vehicles and they said no, I told them just because the other car vibrates does not make it right, it sounds like a design defect to me, this  directive came from the District Service Manager I cannot believe they would actually think that is acceptable, they all vibrate so that makes it acceptable???? Buyer beware I would not buy the 2016 Acura MDX.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " Overall it rides nice and very comfortable. The downside is that the Acura MDX has built quality issues. The panels either don't lineup or the gap is not even. For instance, the fuel door is off center, both side of the trunk lift gate have uneven gaps and both side of the front top fender panels are off and don't lineup with the front bumper. Very disappointed and I would consider other brand of SUV such as Lexus in the near future. If you are in the market for any Acura vehicle, do check for quality built issues. Chances are the panels don't lineup and the gaps are not even.The engine idle stop feature does not work at all after a few miles. In addition, don't even try to connect a smartphone because the vehicle does not recognize it no matter how hard you try. This is not what I anticipated for a new vehicle especially an Acura MDX. My conclusion is I would look to other brand of SUV before considering the MDX.",

  "acura_mdx_2016": " I bought a 2016 Acura MDX within the first week I noticed a vibration between 55 to 75 mph, at 459 miles I took it in to the dealer to install the mounding I had purchased and told them it had a vibration they balanced the tires. It did not solve the problem, took it back a second time where I was told by the service writer that there was nothing wrong with the car, I would find nothing wrong with it and it drives just as well as any car on the lot. You can visibly see the steering wheel shake and feel the vibration. I took it in a third time, took a service technician out with me, he witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating. So I asked, ok we are in agreement that you witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating he said yes, I took his name and wrote it down along with date and time. The dealer had my car for about a week, which they did give me a loaner, they called and said they had figured it out, they replaced the brake rotors. Needless to say the vibration is still there, since then I have taken it to a tire store that told me I had three bad tires, took it back to the dealer, they road force balanced the tires, vibration is still there. I have been in contact with Acura Client Relations since the second service appointment, next step is meeting with the District Service Manager. Not to mention how the transmission shifts, I am hoping they come out with a software update for that. Needless to say I am very disappointed and regret purchasing the MDX.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " I hardly ever write any reviews but figured I just had to do one on this vehicle. I owned a 2010 MDX Tech, which was a great car, that unfortunately got flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Then, I got an ML350 and when the lease was up, we decided that we needed another 7-seat vehicle. So, as we'd already had an MDX before, we figured we couldn't go wrong with that one, right? Wrong! The first thing I noticed on my drive home from the dealership is that the car becomes ridiculously jerky while in traffic. The new 9-speed transmission just doesn't work well for daily city driving or when you're stuck in traffic on a highway. If you live in a rural area, chances are you'll never experience this. But if you're in traffic every day, well... you've been warned. I've adjusted my driving style since then and learned that switching IDS to ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " We recently leased a 2016 MDX AWD with Tech Package. If we were to do it again the smart money would be the base awd model with the AcuraWatch safety feature package. Let me explain why....First off the car rides, accelerates, stops, turns, and everything else regarding moving extremely well. Even the headlights are exceptional. The interior seating design and the way they slide  is also great. The safety features shake the steering wheel if you depart your lane and warn you when other cars are too close.  Whats left is the way you interact with the controls in the dash and on the steering wheel. Every single thing about the interaction with the controls is unnecessarily complicated. In many cases it takes an extra click or 2 in a menu than in other cars. For example to turn seat heater on you need to click a button on the screen, select the heat level, then close the sub-menu. In every other car on the planed you click the button once to turn on the seat heat then another click to change the heating level. I consider this annoying, but not a deal breaker. Then you get into the gps. The gps takes longer than most to figure out how to do the basics. Its cumbersome to enter an address. The guidance is also poor. Sometimes there is no audible instruction on when to turn and a strange map of your turn with a flag that isn't always oriented the way you are travelling.  To sum it up you are better off placing your phone with google maps over the nav screen. I can only hope there is some kind of update to enable android auto or the apple car os. Last but not lease the Bluetooth connectivity doesn't play nice with my samsung galaxy s6. Every 30 seconds or so it pops up an error it can't import the phonebook. A quick google search indicates this is a common issue for many.  Then you quickly find out the text interaction is terrible. When you get a text a notification takes over the entire screen asking what you want to do (imagine you were getting ready to make a turn following gps). So then when you act on the notification you have to pick from a very small list of predefined reply messages. Every other car I have used including cheap rentals allow you to speak a text reply. My other vehicle is 2015 ram 3500 with uconnect and it does all of this with no issues.  In a day and age where so much of your interaction with a vehicle is the electronics acura needs to do a much better job. The kicker is you pay thousands extra for this tech package and get terrible tech bundled with some really good safety features. After having the MDX a few months I can say I would buy it again, but would not get anything above a base model awd with acurawatch.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " It came down to the 2016 Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, BMW X5, and 2015 Toyota Highlander.  We were inclined to get the XC90 for all the safety features , the incredibly cool look. The drive is great, however it felt really risky getting a brand new everything car.  The dealer had been saying they would get in Jan, the first ones did not appear till May and it seemed like they were trying to get it right.  Visibility was ok.  However, loaded with all the safety features it was getting to 60  though it starts at $47 all cars had very confusing option packages , what is considered a safety feature.  The test car 3rd row seat seem to have a problem. Then they recalled the vehicle to fix the third row airbags. We keep cars for 10 years , did not want to be going back to the dealer over and over again. The final straw is when they were offering factory maintenance for all models except the XC90 which had 1 year less of the maintenance.  On a new model they should not insert more doubt.  The BMW drove great but the 3rd row was not big enough for anyone over the age of 12 so had to cross it off.  The highlander felt less luxurious but most importantly did not have all the safety systems that we were looking for so we decided to pass. At the time the 2016 was not out, it appears from the reviews that they have added some safety features. We were left with the pilot and the MDX. In the end, the Pilot's cheap minivan arm rest on the drivers side along with the bad handling and turning radius on turns made us skip it.   Any man over 200 pounds will find there is no way to lean on the arm rest comfortably.  The turning handling and radius were a big concern also as on a sharp turn near our house the car veered into the oncoming traffic lane.  We did it twice.   Finally, unless you get the highest trim the handling is so ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " I typically drive a vehicle for as long as possible. So when my 2003 Toyota Camry was starting to show some signs of wear and tear after 13 years, I decided to check out the new SUV's.  For me I wanted comfort, quiet, smooth handling, navigation package, something easy enough to get my aging parents into, and most importantly something with a solid reputation of being a reliable and quality vehicle.  My pros: I found that I liked sitting a bit higher on the road. The drive is very comfy, quiet and the vehicle is very responsive.  When I test drove the car I got the speed up to 90 entering the interstate before the salesman in the backseat coughed uncomfortably, but the car never hesitated and was very responsive. The headlights provide an amazing view of the road at night. The bluetooth for phone calls is crystal clear. I am using midgrade octane gasoline and I am averaging 24.5 mpg. My cons: I wish the cup holder was a smidge larger so it could hold my bubba cup of water. The navigation system is a little confusing but now that I am used to it things are fine but it took some patience on my part. The driver seat is self adjusting to driver 1 or 2 but I wish that I could get the seat to automatically move further back than it does upon going into park.  I understand that Acura has accessories for sale but I think that for the amount of $$$ you spend they could have included a net in the cargo area to keep the groceries from sliding around, I think it should have been standard not optional. Overall I really have been impressed so far and have not once regretted my purchase.  I don't have any maintenance issues to report after 4 months of ownership.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " My wife and I were in the market for our first luxury crossover and we couldn't be happier with our purchase (Advance Pkg, SH-AWD). Let me say outright that we did not consider any German cars for reasons ranging from high price point/high maintenance to poor reliability/longevity. We weren't particular about having 3-rows, but felt it'd be nice to have the option (for trips with family/friends) - the MDX fit the bill perfectly. I've had my MDX for 6-weeks and driven 1800 miles, so its obviously too early to talk about reliability(which the Acura brand is known for) but here are the pros/cons as I see it.Pros:- Drives great. Plenty of power to summon in any situation (esply with Normal/Sport IDS modes).- Very comfortable seats , ride. You don't feel minor road imperfections , the suspension does a great job of dampening out big potholes.- Very quiet cabin. Conversation between 1st , 2nd row passengers have never been easier.- Gas sipper (I use premium 93 octane). I consistently average over 24-mpg in combined driving. Averaged 26-mpg during a recent 600-mile road trip(80% highway) with 5 adults, fully loaded cargo space (3rd row folded). That said, I always use cruise at highway speeds and avoid very hard acceleration/braking.  I calculate MPG estimates to be 100% sure though the tip computer is not off by much (-0.5 to +1 MPG off actual).- Realized the beauty of SH-AWD driving on curvy, hilly wet roads (yet to test on snow/heavy rain). Just when I thought I needed to hit the brakes to slow around a corner, the MDX breezes past with aplomb. It drives like a car - you don't feel body roll, side-to-side weight transfer during turns.- Love all the safety features, esply the Lane departure warning.  I read recently that it received great crash-test scores.Now for the Cons:- Depending on the gear you are in, the transmission sometimes seems to lag for a split second before it accelerates. I believe this has to do with dog clutch in the ZF-9 speed design. - Adaptive cruise may seem hard on braking/acceleration depending on how you normally drive.- Touchscreen response is a tad slower than I'd like it to be.- Fog lights are offered only as an accessory (extra $)- Power-folding side mirrors, panaromic roof,  motion-activated power liftgate not available.I've seen people voice concerns on online forums regarding transmission, build quality(as MDXs are built now in Alabama Vs Canada until about a couple of years ago)  but based on my experience, I'm inclined to believe most of them are unjustified. There have also been complaints about higher than usual noise coming from under the hood(for someone outside the car) even when the a/c compressor is not running -  the owners manual clearly says that is expected as a result of the system checks ! Complaints related to dual-screen is a matter of getting used to - I actually find it convenient. The 3rd row of seating is mostly for kids (or short adults for upto 2-hr ride). In my opinion, this is the most well-rounded luxury crossover offering an optimal mix of comfort, handling, value and safety. Get one - you'll love it !",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " Purchased my MDX'16 (SH-AWD Adv/ Ent.) 3 months ago. So far so good. Great handling, smooth riding SUV. Quiet and comfortable on the road. Very responsive in sports mode. The infotainment system was not simple to use at first, but when I learned how to use it, I really like it because of its cool advance tech. features. Great sound system. Excellent Rear entertainment system with wide screen that produces a surround sound quality similar to a high end home theater system. Safety features are probably one of the best in it's class. The adaptive cruise control/ lane keep assist are great feature on long drives.Follow up review: after 9 months. So far so good, still an excellent vehicle. no major issues. I really like the push button shifter. Contrary to some reviewers complaint, doing a three point turn is an easy step for me: put the hand over the gear selectors, pull the reverse button to back up with the index and middle finger, push the drive button with the thumb to forward, no arm travel is needed. One minor issue is the back up camera was slow to respond. Just like some of the reviewers here in the site, I also noticed that ocassionally, the drive in lower gear is not smooth particularly in sports mode, but it's not a big deal, for me it has similar feel when driving a manual trabsmission car at 1st gear.Highway mpg is spot on, 26-28 in long drives at 60-70 mph on a flat road. City is around 19-20.The lane keep assist can keep up at 45-65 mph when there is a clear lane marking, at 75mph, I noticed that the car gets too close to the next lane when going on a curvy free way. Adaptive cruise works well in my car but can slam on brakes a bit hard in some occasions particularly when there is a slowing down of traffic in front of you. Not quite as smooth as a human driver braking.To me, the dual infotainment system is cool and high tech looking especially now that I'm used to it, but could still be improved to a nicer, faster, HD graphics. I wish Acura could come up with software upgrades in the future.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " We finally bought our new SUV or I guess they call it a crossover. Keep in mind we only have a few hundred miles on it so its still really early. We looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the MDX. As far as a luxury 7 passenger vehicles go this seemed to have everything we wanted and needed after a couple of weeks of shopping and doing serious looking at the German counter parts. The MDX meets all of our requirements as follows in no specific order. Luxurious, stylish, roomy, safe, quality. We hope the maintenance is low and that it will hold its resale value I guess time will tell. The ride is great in the awd however on bumpy roads you can hear some road noise. The steering is awesome The turning radius is amazing making u-turns a breeze. This is a very easy and stress free vehicle to drive. Unlike most of the reviews I have read the command center is easy to operate we were a little worried after reading the reviews but it is super simple! We thought we wanted the black on black but after looking at the Lunar Silver Metallic we fell in love with how it really accentuates the lines on the vehicle.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " After 1000 miles the new 9 speed transmission can't figure out what gear to use at low speed ( 40 MPH). The ride is jerky or the car surges.

Also the memory seat/steering doesn't always return to the set drivers position and the navigation system worked correctly 1 out of 4 attempts. Knowing what I know now, I would not get this car.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " After owning several BMW's, Mercedes, and lastly a Jeep Grand Cherokee, I decided to look at Acura due to its quality reputation and value.  A comparable BMW or Porsche would have cost 20K more.  I was immediately impressed with the comfort, quality, and performance.  Although not as sporty as BMW products I have owned, it drives and corners smartly.  Probably the quietest vehicle I have owned.  After many dealership visits with the Jeep, I look forward to years of routine service only with the Acura.",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " Before buying, I test drove a 2016 Pilot EX-L and a 2015 MDX. In my opinion, the MDX felt more agile and responsive than the Pilot, and I preferred the MDX's interior and exterior styling over the Pilot. The Good:Car handles incredibly well. Accelerates, turns, and brakes superbly. If you're looking for a three-row SUV, I can't think of anything that would come even close to the same level of performance and value, except perhaps a Pilot. The only other option I considered was the Volvo XC90, but it would cost around 25-30% more, and although I greatly prefer the Volvo's interior and user interface, my friends with Volvos have had issues with reliability. Audi Q7 also looks great, but again price and reliability issues steered me away. So, from a price-performance-reliability standard, the MDX is very hard to beat. I took the MDX on a curvy, secluded mountain highway, and it was truly the most thrilling drive I've ever had. I'm happy with the car.The Bad:The user interface is disgraceful. Acura's worst yet, and that's saying something. Even though the dealer set up the car for my wife and me, my wife's first solo drive in the car had  her near tears because of the maddening user interface. For instance, getting the car to accept her phone's bluetooth connection instead of mine was crazy complex, and you have to go through two entirely separate menus if you want to transfer both the phone operations and the phone's media (e.g., Pandora) from one source to another.  Even everyday tasks like turning on the seat's heaters, adjusting the A/C, or tinkering with the audio settings (e.g., fade/balance) all take multiple levels of menus, requiring too much of the driver's focus and attention. I sorely miss when I could do any of those things with a single gesture (flip a switch! turn a dial!) without having to take my eyes off the road. Now, I have to find the 1 cm square on the display panel that takes me to the menu to adjust the fan. Then the menu changes, and I have to navigate my hand to the ",
  "acura_mdx_2016": " We looked at numerous SUVs and Sedans but kept coming back to the Acura MDX.  Build quality, fit , finish, ride comfort, interior materials, driving performance and styling were equaled only by several of the other Japanese auto makers.  Acura was the only one with a dealership nearby so it wouldn't be a hardship if the MDX does have problems in the future.  This is our fourth Acura so we do have some degree of owner loyalty.  Both of these factors weighed heavily in our decision on which SUV to purchase.However, there are several things that we do not care for and they are as follows,  the automatic stop/start feature is a nuisance (and it cannot be disabled), navigation system and driver / vehicle interface is cumbersome  and complex.  You're better off just learning to use the voice prompt for most commands.  I prefer the Bluetooth connectivity in my 2011 Ford truck than the Acura phone system.  My wife has learned to use Siri on her linked IPhone to make calls from the MDX's Bluetooth connection (it's easier than their system, at least in her opinion).We drove both the two wheel drive and SH-AWD versions and I can say for a fact that the AWD option handles and performs MUCH better in a hard rain.  We typically don't have any snow or Ice in this part of Texas but my guess is that the AWD would do just as well in those driving conditions too.  Another consideration is that when the SH-AWD option ($2000) is purchased, you also get a spare tire and jack.  If you buy these items separately from the dealer they are $510.  The two wheel MDX drive DOES NOT COME with a spare tire. The multiple versions of ride control (e.g. IDS, Comfort, Normal, Sport) are wasted on us.  Why would anyone want to drive a glorified station wagon in Sport Mode, the MDX is not a sports car!  Acura could get away from having to install the VERY expensive magnetic shock absorbers currently in use but I suppose if that's what the competition is doing they have to do it too.Transmission, shift points, smoothness, etc. all seem to be set OK for normal to moderately aggressive driving.

The biggest/best surprise is the SH-AWD (google torque vectoring if you haven't already) which makes the car a lot of fun to drive and adds a spare tire. The ELS sound system is great. The safety features should be standard on all vehicles -- the technology package adds the blind spot detection which is awesome. I was worried that the transmission would at least take some getting used to given the complaints but it's great actually. Their are plenty of YouTube videos explaining why it feels a little funny between 2 gears but I have honestly not had a problem in any IDS mode (sport, comfort, normal). The complaints don't seem to be primarily regarding reliability. I was also worried I wouldn't like the shifter after so many complaints. It is actually very easy to use and keeps me from ever having to look down. It has the added benefit of protecting you from changing gears when you shouldn't (i.e. P while driving, D while shutting off the engine, etc...) which ultimately saves wear on your transmission. Good warranty compared to the other SUVs (7 years on the drive train). The infotainment system is just ok even with the tech package but has all of the functionality I need. I wish that it had a panoramic sunroof. If you compare to other vehicles in the class, for example the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 etc.. or even the Pilot, Pathfinder, Highlander, and Forester, I thought the Acura was ultimately the best bang for your buck.",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " This car has a surprisingly blurry backup camera. Taken back for adjustment/replacement and the tech said ",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " The styling, handling, and safety features are the biggest improvement over previous models.  The addition of the chrome to a black MDX makes it look sharp.  The added safety features are vastly improved. The tranny could be a little smoother. Pairing an android phone can be a tricky situation.  Overall a very good choice for a family or if you need cargo space. Set your cruise control to normal instead of adaptive and set your tranny to sport mode to improve your driving comfort.",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " Super car at a great price the advanced package as every thing you could ask for in a SUV heater and cooled leather seats.Super ride and power, plus a a lot of other features that are just too many to list",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " I've owned it for about a month and from all my experiences so far, I'm very impressed with quality of interior as well as luxury feel of the car. I've driven German cars for the last 5 years and decided to go back to old reliable Japanese-made cars and couldn't be more relieved. After spending a ridiculous amount for maintenance on my 328 iX Drive, looking forward to owning this car and not worrying about the next pothole or the next maintenance project that will cost thousands of dollars.",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " ",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " Love the car, though it has only been a month. For price the fit and finish is fantastic and the active safety features are very good. Electronics are good, though some are tricky to learn.",
  "acura_mdx_2017": " Overall, an excellent piece of engineering and design. It's not 100% perfect on design, but it's pretty darn close.  Let me summarize simply with Pro's and Con's. PRO'S are: Awesome handling with SH-AWD, I mean really awesome. Just about as good as my E92 M3, I totally mean that, for all intents and purposes on the street. The semi-autonomous driving features are great. The Lane Keeping system, the Adaptive Cruise Control with Follow, Blind spot warning, all make it ALOT safer to drive in these days of distracted driving. You must study the functionality of each system to know when you can and should not rely on them. But overall I find them productive and adding to safety for me and those around me. Comfort is 8.5 of 10. Seats are not super duper, but definitely more than acceptable. You can customize the crap out of all the systems, and if you read the 500 page manual like I did, you will be amazed at what this car can do. Walk away auto locking system is quite nice. WIth the right setup in the menu, you never, ever have to take the key out of your pocket/purse. Just walk in, walk out, the car does exactly what you want, when you want it, and you just never touch a button on the remote, EVER.  Worried about the car being locked? You can send it a message via your remote, querying the lock status, and I've tested that at 100 yards remote distance, no problem! Engine is satisfactory - it ain't a Porsche, BMW, but it gets the job done. The 9 spd tranny does fine! All these complaints about transmission hunting around for a gear, but I have not noticed it.  Auto engine stop awesome, auto brake hold system awesome. Headlights are freaking amazing, SO BRIGHT.  Sound system is 8.5/10. I have heard better, but this is totally fine. Mileage is pretty darn good, on a freeway going about 65  you can easily get 25mpg if not closer to 28-29mpg. CON'S: the navigation system sort of sucks, compared to Google Maps. You can't beat Google with it's machine learning and real-time mobile updates on traffic etc. Plus the processor powering the Nav and the Phone menus is slow and outdated. But usable if you have to. One huge con is for USB flash drives, the search functionality is AWFUL, as you can only scroll the huge list of songs or folders, you cannot search by Artist, Title, etc.... If you want to bring your own music, you better have a large iPOD, in which case the Search/Selection functionality is reasonable.  OVERALL: definitely a car you will enjoy taking road trips with.",

  "acura_mdx_2017": " Before you buy this car, try the electronic system with the caveats belowI have been a loyal buyer of Honda cars for years. However this will be my last purchase from them. I have an 2017 MDX. The GPS and entertainment system is unusable. Don't take my word for it try it before you think about a purchase.GPS does not work- If you try take a different turn then directed on the route, most GPS is will recalculate and redirect you. Not this system. They have made a design change where the GPS will actually direct you off the road. Apparently my dealer tells me that they know about the problem for a long time and hoping for a fix. The car does not allow you to cancel the route as you are driving.The voice activated commands absent do not work. Dealer says they know about this. They tell you not to use the voice activated system.The dealer tells me that the MDX system is not entertainment compatible with iPhone (somewhat odd given their popularity).",

  "acura_rdx_2016": " This vehicle is fantastic!  I test drove a Ford Explorer, Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe and I bought the RDX with the tech package.  The reliability reviews over the others was one of the main points but after owning it I really have come to appreciate its high points.  The ride is smooth, powerful and really quiet.  The sound canceling system (like Bose headphones) does a great job. Being a musician, I was impressed with the stereo and during my test drive we adjusted the base and subwoofer to full potential and I was blown away.  The sound quality with the ten speakers in neural mode (surround sound) is amazing. Some reviewers complained about having two screens.  I prefer it and it's much more pleasing to be able to still see your audio screen while navigation is showing on a different screen.  Brilliant!  They recommend 91 octane which basically doesn't exist anywhere so I need to use 93.  I'm not thrilled about that but at least gas is cheap now.  I drive both highway and city to get to work so it seems I'm averaging around 19 mpg. No long trips yet to really see highway mileage. I live in South Florida and I can say that the air really cranks.  Most of the time I only have the fan halfway even though the leather seats in summer can be hot.  The advanced package has ventilated seats but will cost you at least $3500 more on your out the door price.  I passed.  The shortcuts menu, speed dial options, voice prompts and other technology is a big plus.  I went from a stupid car (Honda Accord 2007) to this so it's like walking onto the Enterprise!  I can't imagine anyone buying this car and not liking it.  I paid $40,000 even out the door which seems to be a pretty decent price for a 2017 with the tech package. Updated11/3/2016. I can now confirm highway mileage on a long trip at 29 mpg which is as Acura estimated.  I like this car even more now as I've been using more of the bells and whistles. I REALLY appreciate the back up cross traffic alert.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " Great ride. Dont take that as its a sports car, its not. Just a great cruiser and if you want some fun slip it to sport and use the paddle shifters. Biggest complaint is the voice regonition. Only had it a month but it takes some work to master, and i havnt , and not sure i ever will. Best way is to put in an address before you leave, trying to find a certain restaurant etc on the go gets frustrating. I get better mileage than stated which is a nice surprise. Love the blind spot detector and the backup camera is awesome, really gets a wide view which is great. I am not disappointed with this suv at all, just the oppisite. Best bang for your dollar by far. Oh yeah the seats, especially the cooled option are the most comfortable of all the higher end SUVs, at least for me. Everyone has a different butt and back but for me its like sitting in my lazy boy.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " the good stuff - overall a very nice ride. Good safety tech, stereo, looks and power. Stable at speed and good mid range power.

Several of the electronic features are very helpful.         The  not so great stuff - Transmission hunts a bit at low speeds on occasion, the nav system is a pain trying to use voice recognition to get a location. Still cant figure out how to just enter an address manually. Mileage is not as good as I had hoped but, mostly city driving so far so may improve.  It came down to this and a Lincoln MKC with 2.3 turbo. the Lincoln was faster and more luxurious but, went with the Acura for better resale value.",

  "acura_rdx_2016": " The RDX probably isn't the best vehicle in the small luxury SUV category in any particular attribute, but it does score near the top in most attributes, and it's that, combined with a price $10,000 or more lower than similarly equipped competition, that makes it a great buy as well as a very enjoyable vehicle.  We've found it very comfortable on a long road trip and around town.  We also feel that the understated styling will endure over time without looking odd or dated.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " Great car to drive.  Adaptive Cruise, lane change warning and other safety features are just awesome.  Brakes are terrific.  Compared to our Lucerne, road noise is much worse, but tolerable interior is not par w/price.  Ride is pretty good for suv.  Acura cheaps out on some features that will annoy you every time you drive it.  For the RDX, only one of the two key remotes w/the applicable pkg will start the car.  With the MDX, both remotes will do it.  Guess Acura saved a couple bucks to hack off customers.   Bad design is driver seat position.  Our Buick had it right..seat went all the way back when ignition turned off, making getting out really easy, after getting in, push driver 1 or 2 and seat, outside mirror, and interior mirror repositioned.  With the RDX, using the driver 1 or 2 setting, the seat positioned PRIOR to getting in.  For us short people, that made getting in difficult.  The inside mirror also was not among the setting.  We had to disable the seat positioning setting.  A really bad design.  Door panels are sorta cheap also.  Overall, a nice car, fun to drive but some cheap outs.  Not worth the price..but close.",

  "acura_rdx_2016": " My wife never had a SUV and wanted one to be our next one. She has been driving an 08 awd Acura RL and loved it. We put snow tires on it for the winter and it was a tank in the snow with the SH awd. So for us to trade it in was a big deal. I started doing some research on Edmund's and started to list the suv's we should consider. I test drove over 12 myself and reduced it down to 5 we should consider. We decided to stay in the mid size or smaller range since it is just the two of us. We picked one day to test drive all 5 for comparison. The Lexus NX and RX were the first she drove. Next she drove the Acura RDX then the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe. The RDX beat them all with the 6 cylinder engine, it was by far the most peppy of them all and drove more sporty than the RX. It seems like everyone has an RX these days so they are kinda of boring to us. The RDX is full of technology which has been greatly been improved upon since we had it in our RL. The biggest is the blind spot, auto braking, cross traffic and adaptive criuse control. I have using them and they help greatly with driving. We are happy with our decision and have found acura's hold their resale value as well as being reliable. By the way, the Hyundai Tucson was our second choice, which we may buy as a second car in the future. It is about $10000 less than the RDX and has alot of the same features.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " I bought this car because the ride is quiet, the acceleration is excellent, the ride is comfortable, it has a very good safety rating and safety technology is state of the art. I also liked the Acura's reputation for reliability. I enjoy a good sound system and the RDX with the Advance package is among the best I have heard in a car. We drive a lot of miles each year on long vacation driving trips. Since the car is also used around town, the smaller size of this SUV is convenient as it rides well on a trip but also easy to park in a city.  There have been a couple of surprises. While I knew the car had great safety features, I had not really experienced the changes introduced to my life by this car until taking it on a trip shortly after buying the car. The surprise is that it requires changing how to drive in many respects and requires a new driver for this car to adjust to the technology.Specifically, the ability of the car to adjust its speed with the traffic. Don't misinterpret: I like the changes but on a busy interstate, one needs to pay attention to adjust to the changes. Cars and trucks pull in front of a car unexpectedly. The first time this happened, the Acura RDX slowed dramatically and automatically. I did not have to apply the brakes. Several days into this driving trip, I had adjusted and found myself becoming almost lackadaisical about this feature as the car almost adjusts itself. Driving is more relaxing. On a busy highway, I disabled the system though as the distance between my car and the next vehicle was long, even with the lowest setting, and occasionally a large number of cars would continually pull in front and constantly slow down our pace of driving.I did not like the feature of adjusting the steering  when changing lanes or moving in traffic. I turned this feature off quickly. No doubt, I will try it again but doubt it will be useful or one that I will use with any regularity. I prefer to drive the car and change lanes as necessary without objection from the computer in the car.My biggest complaint in an otherwise excellent vehicle is the navigation system. I don't like it or how in integrates with the other system technology. The navigation systems in previous cars are much better. The Acura system is not intuitive or designed with the driver or consumer in mind. It works with the voice control but the list of possible commands is long and ignores some of the most common features available on other vehicles.I still do not know if I can send instructions to the car to follow a route I have created on the computer. The Acura site indicates I can do this. The salesman who sold us the car said he had never heard of that feature. A system like this works well on a Mercedes that I own. The manual is silent on on how to do it. The website offers no advice. I do not mind making a call with Acuralink to enter the destination but would prefer to map it out myself to select my own routes.The ability to use the smartphone with the Acura's system is an excellent innovation. I also like being able to stream a podcast or Pandora through the stereo system. Sirius XM generally works well with the Acura although the traffic and weather features do not integrate with the RDX. We used those features extensively with a 2012 Murano and this lack of integration is a significant failing of a luxury SUV. There is weather and traffic information on the RDX, it is not up to Sirius.Unfortunately, the navigation system operates in its own universe. The voice system giving directions cannot be heard clearly while sound is coming through these other systems. Instead, the systems yammers away incessantly with turns and directions while leaving the stereo system as a higher volume. Moreover, attempts to turn down the navigation system with the voice controls apparently cannot be done. At least I have not found a way to do this or to find in the documentation how it can be done.In my older Murano, I was able to know when the next rest area was coming up as well as when the next exit was coming up. Not so in the Acura. Asking for rest areas results in a list of rest areas, some of which may be behind on the route being traveled or may be many miles ahead. The information is useless. One friend who bought an Acura said he gave up and bought a Garmin navigation system to use instead of the built in system. I now know how he felt and I am inclined to agree. The nav system in the RDX is a major disappointment. As a person who uses a system like this extensively on trips, I have already found using Google maps or Waze on my IPhone to be much more useful and easier to use. With an MSRP of $45,000 for this luxury SUV, I expected much better. Moreover, the Acura salesman was not well versed in how to use the system so learning how to use it has been largely trial and error and stopping occasionally to check the manual to see if we missed something that would make it more useful.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " Owned the 2016 RDX for 2 months.  Bought the FWD with technology package.  The RDX has the best overall engine for small SUV.  Same engine as the MDX, but much smaller car means better performance.  Great HP for its class.  Very good gas fuel economy and uses regular unleaded gas.  Other SUV's that had similar HP were turbo charged engines that required premium gas (i.e. more expensive to operate).  Transmission is 6 speed automatic that is very smooth and shift points are perfect.  Ride quality is a little stiff, but that helps with handling.  The car is very quite when windows are rolled up.  Seats are very comfortable.  Very nice dual displays (one of which is touch screen).  Premium stereo with XM and HD FM.  I like the HD FM sound quality.  It has a 15GB hard disc so you can save CD's or transfer songs from USB stick.  There are 2 key fobs that you can customize most of the car features for each.  Seating position, radio settings, navigation settings, are just a few of the items.  Car recognize which key is closer and those settings are active for that driver.  Very nice.  Only a few negatives:  Lots of wind noise when back windows are down more than about 1 inch.  The electronics take about 1 minute to boot up when you start the car.  Does not sound like much, but much slower than my Lexus that is 8 years older.  Navigation system works good, but a little funky to set.  Sound quality is good compared to standard quality systems, but less than other premium systems.",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " This is my 2nd RDX. My first was a 2014, which I was happy with, despite a few minor irritations. The 2016 took care of my irritations with added technology, specifically the blind spot and rear traffic warning sensors and changes in the technology package. The RDX has two good blind spots so the new tech is fantastic and solves the issues - and works beautifully. The 2016 feels heavier and drives smoother than the 2014. The steering feels better and more substantial, as well.  It is also quieter with less wind noise and a smoother sunroof mechanism.   I did purchase a wind deflector this time though. I love the 3D navigation viewing option and the 10-speaker sound system is wonderful.  I've had Acuras since 2000 - three TLs (2000, 2003 and 2008), the 2014 RDX and now the 2016 RDX.  My 2000 TL had transmission issues, which were taken care of by the dealer even though the warranty had expired. I've always been treated well by the Dealer (in South Orange County in California).  I did not test drive competitors' vehicles, but did a lot of research on the Lexus RX, Lincoln MDX, Mercedes GL and GLK and some of the BMW and Audi SUVs, which would have fit into my budget. At the end of the day, I could not justify a higher cost for the competitors (when comparing the multitude of packages available with the competition), even though they may be more prestigious in name and perhaps more luxury interiors.  The value, quality and solid luxury of the Acura won out when I decided not to tie up more of my money and still have all the bells and whistles you get with the RDX.",

  "acura_rdx_2016": " This is our 3rd RDX and I must say the 2011 was best the best handling and most fun to drive although kinda choppy. I liked that, wife didn't. We got the advanced package and the tech is way much and rather complicated for her. It's her car and she likes it. Got the advanced because of parking sensors front and back and nicer rims. Biggest complaint was the lack of color selection (did away with silver-now slate silver BLUE) ugh. Bought the white. Almost went to BMW because of that. Interior selection also limited, parchment only with white, no black. They still insist on a 16 gallon tank, way too small considering mileage has been about 21. Always stopping to feel up. Took a small 200 mile trip and still about 22.5. We've never had an issue with an Acura product and love our dealer. Have a 12 TSX and 14 TL SHAWD as well. Love them all. In retrospect tech would have been fine at 3000 less. And yes she would buy again.UPDATE Have now had this vehicle 7 months and still not sure of the tech stuff and not liking most of it. Hard to see buttons and writing on them. Find myself searching all the time. Dual screen is foolish, makes no sense and is distracting while driving and hard to see in sun. Stupid that you cant operate phone book while driving. I guess designers think it's safer to pick up a phone and start searching. My 12 TSX and 14 TL both tech so much more user friendly. Find myself looking for those keys when heading out. Wife can have this thing, doesn't bother her because she ignores tech anyway.",

  "acura_rdx_2016": " We expected the RDX to be a great car but it has exceeded all our expectations.  The tech packages work fantastic.  The only issue is it offers so much tech that we keep learning new ways to operate the vehicle.  The car is very quiet, the ride is smooth and the mileage is very good for a new vehicle.  I would recommend the RDX to anyone looking for a smaller vehicle but needs lots of room for riders (I'm 6",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " This is my second RDX.  I had a 2013 Base AWD drive model which was a very nice car but lacked the technology options.Now I have an Advanced AWD and the technology looks promising but disappoints again.  The Nav system has only level of directions no verbose or minimal.  The instructions do not override the radio .  I would like to have the radio go silent so I can hear the instructions. Yes I can turn the instructions off which is nice.The speed limit is not shown (nicer would be if the speed would go red if I above it - either 1 mph or some amount I specify).  The nice folks at Acura could not help me move my addresses from my Garmin to the Acura Nav system.Wonder if Acura will ever truly think through the tech on their cars?",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " Just leased a 2016 Acura RDX AWD Base.  Picked it up on July 31st and have put over 500 miles on it so far.  My purchase rational is comparing my parents Honda CRV EX-L Navigation versus a base RDX.  First and foremost the biggest difference between the CRV and RDX besides the Acura beak is the great 3.5 liter motor which has plenty of kick and power unlike the whiny CVT.  My father loves the great MPG on his CRV but hates the lack of power and secondly he hates the motor and wind noise.  The RDX has great pickup, the exhaust notes are smooth and crisp, and cabin noise is much better than a CRV and equal to my 2011 Lincoln MKZ.  The seats are comfy but the base comes with leatherette which is a little of a bummer, but the leatherette is still much better than the material used in an EX-L Honda.  The base is pretty bare bones and really to get the most bang for your buck the Acura Watch is the best option to choice.  Some standard features like blue ambient lighting,  turn signals, power lift gate, backup camera, keyless entry, push to start ignition, and sunroof are all notable.  The center stack and steering wheel still has way too many buttons. Visibility isn't great out of the back and getting Acura Watch w/ backup sensors would really help.  For a luxury car I would like to have seen backup sensors and blind spot warning standard.  Acura recommends premium fuel and on my first 2 tanks I have gotten 19 MPG average and 22 MPG average, hopefully after breaking in the motor and going for longer highway trips I will average 22-26 MPG.  Steering is good but numb and ride comfort is okay.  The RDX is firmer than I imagined and tends to bounce you around when going over bumps.  Value wise the RDX is hard to recommend over the CRV unless your like myself or my dad who finds the CRV to be noisy and slow and you don't prioritize MPG.  If the lack of power doesn't bother you a cheaper CRV is your bet.Update:  June 2016 I actually sold the car after owning it for about 12 months.  Nothing wrong with the car but downgraded to an ILX due to space, mpg, and the car's eventual lease buyout.  I still stand by the fact that the RDX is the best value for a compact/midsize luxury crossover.  The tried and true 3.5 V6 has a ton of pickup and does 0-60 in about 6 seconds, while still getting 20/28 while smaller four cylinder turbo charged cars such as the Lexus NX get 22/28 mpg.  Moving to an ILX the biggest thing I noticed right away is space, since the RDX has plenty of it, whether your upfront, sitting in the back, or loading the trunk.  Also, the RDX is extremely composed and quiet compared to the ILX.  Uneven pavement, potholes, highway cruising the RDX is almost Lexus quiet.  The thing that I disliked about the RDX the most was that I got the base version so no real leather, no touch screen, no app integration, no safety features like  blind spot or adaptive cruise control, no ventilated front seats or heated rear seats.  Furthermore the RDX was just more car than I needed for grocery duties and weekend driving.  If I had kids, did more highway driving, or lived in a place with more snow or rain than the RDX would have been perfect.  Another great aspect of the RDX is the car's value.  I put maybe 7500 miles on it over 12 months and the car's value was almost $2000 above the lease buy out creating equity.  So if you are looking for a car that holds it value the RDX is great",
  "acura_rdx_2016": " Have had our 2016 RDX with Value package for about 500 miles.  We don't use the Bluetooth (don't talk on the phone while driving), but all the electronics seem great.  Phenomenal stereo system - easily the best we've ever had in a car.  The only real shortcoming is wind noise.  We test drove the vehicle twice and both times it was raining.  Now that we've driven the car for 500 miles I can truly say the wind noise is nothing short of ridiculous.  Yes, I know there is a three layer seal in the doors, but that doesn't stop the wind noise.  I don't know that we've never owned a car with wind noise this bad.  It's totally unacceptable for most cars, but for a car with a sticker price of roughly $43k it is shameful.  Cranking up the stereo is the only way to avoid hearing it all.",

Had vehicle towed to the dealer on July 15 and there it still sits as of July 29.   They replaced the cluster and that did not fix it.  Now they traced it to a wiring harness.   The dash of my new car has been disassembled and will never be the same nor will I ever be able to trust it.   I can already hear all the rattles.

  "acura_rdx_2017": " It's been a long road till I pulled a triggered and leased 2017 base model AWD RDX. I also looked at BMW x1 , x3 and infinity Qx30 , QX50. Acura was a winner due to the best deal and dealership experience. I traded in my 2011 3 series that I loved but the CPO warranty was about to expire and I refuse to pay for fixing cars so in order to prevent it I decided to get a new car. I wanted awd because we go often to the mountains. I did not want the technology package because I hate having too many buttons and features even though I'm very computer savvy. I just assume that simple solutions are always the best. My fiancee got x3, retail price 10k more- it was a demo so its fully loaded but my car drives almost as nice as his and mine gets better gas milage even though his is 4 cylinder turbo. I got 22 freeway and 20 combined which is exactly the same as my beemer and better than my 2011 AWD Nissan Rogue! I consider that very good and I hope it will stay at this level (BTW unlike most people I do manual gas milage calculation every time I go to the gas station and don't rely on the computer readings because they are hardly ever accurate- beemer was most accurate). My other car option was x1 since I've always liked but it would cost me still more than Acura and it is a much more smaller car. RDX is equivalent of x3 and is a perfect size for me. Base model had keyless entry, moonroof , heated seat and back up camera which is all nice to have. The drive quality is very good, X3 has a better suspension but is also a stiffer ride due to run flat tires and bigger rims. I was very dissapointed with how much my 3 series depreciate during my 3 years of ownership that I'm not longer their loyal customer. They also stopped offering free brakes in the first 4 years of ownership which was another bummer. ON top of everything I think their cars are kind of outdated looking so its time for major overhaul. I might consider the x3 in 3 years if they come up with the nice design. Not that my Acura is a hot looking car because its super bland but the deal i got justifies it. The lease on Acura and Infinity was much cheaper for a very simple reason - Japanese cars don't depreciate as much as German cars. Anyway RDX is great car and the only downside is there will be  anew model coming up soon thats why I opted to lease. Highly recommended, safe and efficient vehicle.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " I just got this recently, so I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I think that I have a pretty good idea of what this car is. Likes: the power and the price. Those were the two main factors that made me pull the trigger. They had a great lease deal and I really wanted a V6 instead of a turbo 4. Other cars I considered were the new Lexus RX350 (which was at least $150 more a month), the BMW X3 and the 3-series GT (probably $200 more a month, and their down payments are considerably more) and the Lexus NX 200t (smaller and turbo engine). The build quality is great. I got the base model with the leatherette seats and they feel very nice, other than the strong plastic smell. No sweet leather smell here. I like that this is lower than most SUVs, so it handles so much better and if feel almost like, dare I say, a sporty sedan. I had a Toyota Highlander before, and I wanted to avoid the dynamics of a heavy and soft SUV. . . It was a pregnant cow on wheels. The RDX's engine sounds sweet and pulls great -- the transmission, on the other hand, is slow and outdated. Forget using the paddle shifters, they are slow and there's a jerk when downshifting. Better just use your foot and/or sport mode and leave the paddles alone. This engine with modern 8-speed transmission would kill. Comfort is okay. Some people have complained about RDXs having suspension problems. The car doesn't like bumps. You can feel and hear the suspension working and I do think it's a design flaw, but not a defect per se. I did have suspension problem on a 2011 Honda Odyssey, and after multiple trips to the dealership and opening a case with corporate, they were never able to fix it. It's just like every other manufacturer, they have known problems with their car and they jerk you around until you give up. I personally like the simple entertainment system in this base model. Acura's technology package is outdated. I do wish the stereo was a bit better, but I can live with it. Bluetooth always pairs without fail with my iPhone 6. All in all, this is a great small SUV if you want acceleration, a bit of luxury, decent cargo space, and a low price. I think that naturally aspirated V6s are a dying breed, and by the time this lease is up, I'd probably be faced with choosing a 4-cyl turbo, or some type of hybrid system -- which I guess wouldn't be that bad. So far I'm getting 18 mpg (90% city traffic), and that combined with a smallish fuel tank has me going to the pump more frequently than I'd prefer.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " I owned a Lexus NXt200 for the last two years and have been a Lexus guy for 20 years. Still love their cars. However, I have been driving the  the RDX for the last two months and can definitively say it is far and away a better car than the NXt for my money. In short: the RDX interior feels more luxurious acceleration is much smoother car is quieter and the technology such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure and blind spot monitoring make long trips much less stressful. You almost feel like you are a pilot monitoring a plane on auto pilot versus constantly turning cruise control on and off and fighting your way through traffic. It's more like you glide your way through traffic on the interstate. Of course, no car is perfect and there is still room for tweaks and improvements. For example, if you are on the interstate in the left lane and going around a long curve the car senses the the car ahead of you in the right lane is actually in front of you and slows down unnecessarily. But this is a rare and minor annoyance, especially compared the the raft of positive attributes this car possesses. I highly recommend you check it out during your due diligence period when shopping for a mid-size SUV. I am extremely happy I did.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " It turned out to be just an OK SUV.  The fit and finish is not in par with other luxury vehicle's of the same category.  There seems to be some rattling and squeak issues.  So far I have put about 2500 miles mostly highway.  Gives decent mileage for a V6 engine.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " I have a 2017 Acura RDX and ever since 500-800 miles alignment issues, dash board noise , steering wheel noise , front brakes make noise. This is leased car and I don't have confidence that this is a great car with ongoing issues that dealer can't fix. Disappointed",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " My wife wanted a small, luxury SUV and we settled on a 2017 Acura RDX AWD base model.  It is a solid SUV with nice features for a base model.  No squeaks or rattles.  Initial gas mileage was 25 mpg before the cold weather settled in, dropping it to a still respectable 23 mpg.  I like the variable cylinder management that shuts off 3 cylinders during low output conditions.  It is such a smooth process you don't know when it is happening.  The technology interfaces are kind of old fashioned for an upper end vehicle.  No touch screens or fancy graphics.  Buttons and knobs are nicely laid out, but I wish fan speed was controlled by a knob instead of buttons.  Radio does not stay on after car shuts off.  Seats are comfy, but leatherette surfaces are more like plastic than leather.  Heated seats warm up fast, but I miss a heated steering wheel.  Elevated rear seats are nice with plenty of legroom.  Great visibility out rear and side windows.  The 19.5 gallon gas tank could be larger.   The AWD version comes with a spare tire instead of a tire repair kit.  Headlights look and function great.   Overall, happy with the vehicle.  It doesn't necessarily have the feel of a luxury vehicle, but we don't feel we paid a luxury price for it either.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " This RDX is gorgeous and unassuming!  (I'm still getting used to it as I've owned it for less than 30 day.) I treated myself with the top of the line all the bells and whistles!!  I love it!!  The only issues I see is with the Navigation system and headlights.   I traded a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and expected Acura's Navigation system to be superior, however to my surprise my Cherokee's was far more superior and so intuitive.  I didn't need to read the manual or look up any info regarding it.  Also although Acura advertised the best headlights I can't see a difference from my 2015 Cherokee.  As I said I do LOVE this SUV, the ride is very comfortable and I love the AWD and all the safety features.  I think this is a great value and I plan to keep this SUV forever!!",

The dealer Crown Acura in Clearwater, Fl was excellent to work with. Chris Duncanson made me very happy during the purchase process. Buy it!  You'll love it!",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " Even though we got the base RDX model, I was really surprised that to see the CRV from Honda (Acura's sister company) had some features the RDX did not.  From my perspective, the base RDX should have more features than the highest-end CRV considering the Acura higher end positioning.  Overall, we like the car, but just disappointed on how Acura cut corners.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " I have not had my SUV that long, less than a month but I must say I was a little apprehensive about the purchase but after a few days found out that I love it. Gas mileage is not as bad as I thought it would be, some options I would like to have is adjusting the lift gate (hit the garage door when in the garage) my other SUV you could adjust.  Size is great, more roomy than I thought it would be and I am very happy with the safety features.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " Love my 2017 RDX , only has 1,200 miles, but I've had to bring it in to dealership for repairs already!   First incident:   Navigation screen kept freezing up and or did not work properly.  At one point, I was in Drive but the screen showed the rear view camera on.  Very unnerving!  I had to pull off the road on several occasions, turn off engine and then restart the car.   When I brought car to dealer, they claimed that they did not see the problem.  However, after I picked up the car, the problem seems to have disappeared.   Hmmm.....                                          Second  incident:   The brakes started squeaking.   Thought it would go away but, no.   Brought it back in and was told that something was defective in the installation.  They had to put in brand new brake pads.   Really???    A brand new car????    So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else will go wrong.   Love the comfort and safety of the car.   Fun driving!",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " Car is great overall the only thing I didn't like were the lights in cargo area and trunk space could be a little bigger but besides that car is fun to drive and also changing the gas from 91 to either 93 or 89 octane because I don't see 91 everywhere I go car has great features and very comfortable to drive through and weather good car over all and I do love the way it drives",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " Conducted extensive research on the RDX before I went to the dealership.  I scored an excellent deal and got the car that I wanted.  I agree with Edmunds review that it is quick to brake when there is plenty of space that does not require the over reaction.  Love the dual screen and while there is a learning curve on the navigation,  my phone app has a better navigation then what Acura provides.  Still.  It's not a deal breaker and I look forward to when I get to drive my car- which is a first for me.  Definitely a smooth, quiet ride.  And very comfortable on all fronts.  Just love it.",

The V6 is very smooth and has some get up and go.  I love all the safety features in the advanced package.  I really like the navigation and being able to send destinations from your phone to your car navigation and calling Acura link to find a destination while driving.  The only thing lacking is there is no remote start option on the app.",

I had narrowed it down to the Acura RDX awd and Lexus NX and briefly thought about waiting until the new Honda CRV makes it's debut next month. Well, I just pulled the trigger on the RDX with all the bells and whistles, and I couldn't be happier.  It drives beautifully. It is quiet, responsive, and displays impressive handling.  Although the tech is probably of 2015 vintage (no apple car play or android auto), with ACC, LKAS, blind spot monitoring, collision mitigation, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, and stability control, I reallyb don't feel that I am sacrificing anything. I have no problem with the double screen setup, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, I enjoy having the big map always being displayed on the upper screen.  The ",

Very comfortable seats and ride, however, I've had a little difficulty finding and ideal driving position.  I am very tall and with the seat all the way back to accommodate my legs, the steering wheel does not telescope quite far enough to be completely comfortable.  Many complain about the two screen technology but I like it very much.  I also own a Corvette so I like to go fast, and as a result I'm only averaging about 21 mpg around town, but that's fine with me since I had a Ford Explorer Sport before this and only got 17 mpg with that.  Overall, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this vehicle.  I really like the styling, with the door handles contoured to the belt line and the LED headlights.   I also like the clean back end with no bumper sticking out below the hatch and not visible exhaust tips (and yes I do like the four exhaust trumpets on my Vette).",

Instrumentation is the only negative as it is very confusing and not easy to intuitively understand the functions.

Ride, handling, safefy features such as lane departure and lane departure assist are outstanding!  So glad I decided on the RDX.",

The new Lexus is bigger than my previous Lexus and I did not want that large a vehicle.  I had test driven an Acura previously and went to the Acura dealer to check them out.  I love the design, I bought the RDX Advance, it is larger than the Acura I test drove 5 years ago, it is a great size for me.  It has a lot of bells and whistles' that is, technology features.  It is taking me a while to master them. But, I love the lane assist and blind spot warning, which takes no tech knowledge to operate.  I have only had the car 3 weeks, but so far, love it.  It drives so smoothly, with no noise.  The seats are very comfortable, great lumbar support.  I look forward to several years of great driving with this Acura RDX.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " As the owner of a 2016 Acura MDX, my wife loved driving it but wanted something a little smaller. She drove a number of vehicles and came back to the Acura RDX. It was the best mix of comfort, luxury, sportiness, and safety of any vehicle she test drove. She is currently 3 weeks in to ownership and completely loves it. She was coming from an Infiniti G37, so was used to great acceleration. The RDX doesn't disappoint as it's one of the quickest vehicles in it's class. The only complaints would be average to below average navigation system and lack of power folding mirrors, panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel, backseat climate controls, and Android Auto / Apple Car Play.

Highly recommend!  Love mine.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " First Acura.  We (truthfully my wife) were looking for a medium size SUV to replace our 2001 Honda Odyssey.  We test drove the RDX, Lexus RX 350, Nissan Murano, and a loaded out Honda CRV.  RDX was our first choice by a mile.  Super smooth power train and very quiet/smooth ride.  Easily best value in its class.  Back seat room is exceptional for two adults but three would definitely be a crowd.  Only downsides include cludgy technology/interfaces, smallish gas tank, and somewhat narrow driver and front passenger seating.",
  "acura_rdx_2017": " This is a vehicle that compares to competing brands that are much more expensive. I bought this RDX while trading in my larger MDX. The biggest difference is this is the little brother to the MDX and does not have the 3rd row of seats and thus less cargo space as well. I didn't need the space and welcomed the smaller SUV with better gas mileage! If I have any complaint at all it is that the front driver seats appears to be much smaller than the one that was in my 2012 MDX. It has been taking me awhile to get used to it. The bigger MDX seemed to have more support particularly with a bigger seat body that went up to the back of my knees. Other than that the car is fantastic. First time having cooling ventilating front seats which is a joy during the hot days. Definitely go with the Advance Package. All the goodies that go with it are worth the price!",

  "acura_tlx_2016": " Let me start by saying I have mixed feelings about this car. When I first began the lease, I was in love with this car. Great highway fuel mileage, very comfortable, love the safety tech, great night visibility with LED headlights, good amount of power, and with the SH-AWD this car is a unstoppable in snow. Seriously, I have never owned a vehicle that performs so well in snow. I leased my TLX due to the Acura's reputation for outstanding reliability. Unfortunately, I have learned that reliability is not one of the TLX's strong suits. The car has been back to the dealerships 3 times within under a year of owning it. Each time with a list of problems. The fuel pump has been replaced already, entire dashboard of car removed to replace the fan blower motor that screeched every time climate control was turned on. The car is pretty quiet going down the road, just making the many rattles within the car even more noticeable. The blind spot monitoring system on the passenger side acts up, and the adaptive cruise control will turn off randomly, not working again until the car is turned off and started again. At random times the heated seats refuse to work until again, the car has been turned off and started again. I was planning to purchase this car after the lease was done, but that is the last thing I would like to do at this point. I am extremely disappointed as this is not the reliability I was expecting from a $45k car, especially an Acura. I am currently working with the dealership to have this car taken back early.",

  "acura_tlx_2016": " I bought a new 2016 TLX 2.4 in August 2016.   My fifth Acura.  I was assured by the dealer that, even though I'd read that the 2015 cars were experiencing transmission issues, the problem had been resolved in the 2016 models.  Right away I began experiencing transmission hiccups in lower gears as speed increased.  The car would hesitate significantly, then lurch forward as I increased speed.   Really scary, especially when leaving a rest area or going onto a highway from an on ramp.  Worse, as I braked and then almost came to a stop, the car sometimes jerked forward.  This situation was truly dangerous.  There is a class action filed in California concerning this precise issue.  You should also know that the tech package is really worthless at best and another safety issue at worst.  The brake warning beep and signal as well as the rear assist signal operate completely without regard to whether a car, person, or object is nearby.  The dealer tried to fix these problems twice, once in October and once during the MONTH they had the car in December.  I got it back in January and drove it 45 miles.  During that period, I experienced no fewer than eight of the transmission incidents described above.  I have read that even when the transmission is replaced, the problem hasn't resolved.  I finally refused to drive the car any more, fearing for my life or that of a pedestrian.  Please do NOT buy this car.  It is not safe.",

  "acura_tlx_2016": " The 3.5 V6 has awesome acceleration in Sport and Sport+ mode, 0-60 in 5.7 seconds. Not surprising given the 290 HP 3.5L V6, what is surprising is the 31MPG combined city/Hwy fuel economy that I am now getting even with car in Sport mode all the time. This car has an extremely quiet cabin and an awesome 10 speaker surround sound system that sounds like a concert hall in your car. I recommend anybody in the market for a midsize luxury sport sedan give this car a drive and compare to any in it's class. It is many thousands less for more and 5 star safety and the Honda/Acura reliability and resale value I can confirm thru years of resales and trade ins with Acura is among the best of any make. It simply cannot be beat for a luxury sport sedan of this caliber and all that you get especially with the Technology package.  Transmission issues reported on the 2015 are non existent on the 2016 and 2017 TLX, Acura upgraded the software and the issues from 2015 are gone, which is why I waited a model year before buying this new TLX vehicle.This is the best luxury sport sedan I have ever owned. The styling is conservative but sharp, the luxury is just what you would want without being over the top, and with Sport+ or Sport mode the 3.5L V6 FWD performance is awesome with documented 0-60 in 5.7 seconds (see zero to sixty website for TLX V6 FWD), it turns on a dime with excellent handling, and with the quietest cabin and smoothest ride you will find. With 5 star NHTSB crash ratings, and IIHS Top Safety Pick+ it is one of the safest vehicles on the road, and with the Tech package collision avoidance warning technology I personally avoided several very close call lane change accidents on my commute to and from work. If you are in the market for a luxury sport sedan and are looking to keep the price at or below 40$K, you will not find a better car in this class as the competitors will charge at least  11- 20 $K more for similar trim levels/options. I am a very pleased happy Acura TLX owner.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " If you purchase this car in white, the interior options are only dark colors.   My car has the white exterior with the gray leather seats.  However, the  interior gets so hot because of the cheap black plastic dashboard and black plastic door trim which consumes a large portion of the interior cabin.   The air conditioner can't compensate for the intense heat buildup when the car is parked outside in the hot Florida sun.  This car has the seats that are supposed to cool and this function really does not help much. My 2009 Acura had  a BEAUTIFUL tan interior and a really good air conditioner that cooled the car so well.   I am so disappointed in the 2016 TLX, that I wish I would have kept my 2009.  The 2016 TLX was purchased for the safety features which are superb, but the car is so uncomfortably hot, that we will consider another brand the next time we purchase.  I do not know why Acura does not offer lighter color LEATHER INTERIOR SEATS anymore.  Plastic seats in Florida are like sitting in a plastic bag.

  "acura_tlx_2016": " I will never buy Acura again. This is my second Acura and fifth car manufactured by Honda. I have been a loyal Honda customer, had two Accords and a Civic. Loved each one. Then, when my spouses Mercedes C300 4matic got totaled, we decided to try 2013 Acura TSX 4cyl (Tech package), and we were very impressed with it. Car had certain finesse about it, the interior was made of quality materials, it was crafty and had a decent feel about it. Engine and transmission were flawless. So, needless to say that when we received an invitation from Acura to trade in our older TSX for a brand new TLX (for the same monthly leasing price, with zero out of pocket costs, tax, tags, registration included) we were excited and jumped on it. Dealership was great, their customer service and finance department catered to all of our whims. They took off over $5000 off MSRP and we ended up leasing 2016 SH AWD TLX V6 Tech package with literally no cost except the first months leasing payment ($33/mo over TSX tech, but this is AWD, V6, nearly $10K more expensive car). But weren't we disappointed when we got behind the wheel! Yes, there is no way you can buy so many options in a car for $37,000 if you got with BMW, Mercedes or Audi. But at what cost!

Very economical given the 2.4 liter engine.  This was a 2016 closeout lease and I got a very good deal from Prime Acura of Walpole.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " After owning a 2009 and 2012 TL, I purchased a 2016 TLX SH-AWD Tech Package and so far I love driving it.  The transmission is gets a little confused when starting from a stop in city driving.  The Auto Start/Stop and Econ Mode really help with the gas mileage, you can really tell the difference from the TL in that aspect.  There is also a lot of power hidden in the car as well.  Try sitting a red light, turn off the HVAC system, turn on Sport Plus, and hit the gas when the light turns green.  The SH-AWD eliminates wheel spin and torque steer and you take off like a rocket.  The front seats are very comfortable.  The head unit is a little cumbersome at first but you get use to it.  The Lane Keep Assist is very impressive when using cruise control.  I recently drove from DC to Ocean City, Maryland and got 37 MPG is highway driving in Normal Mode with the A/C on.  I never got that type of gas mileage in either of the TL's I owned previously.  The TLX may not stand out in the day time but at night when you see the Jewel-eye headlights in your rearview mirror then you see the distinctive taillights as it passes, you'll know that's a TLX.  This is an all around good car.  Now for my gripes.  I wish Acura didn't hide the exhaust tips.  The interior fit and finish could be a little better.  My trim piece covering the speaker on the dash board is slightly dislodged.  No doubt I will have the dealer address this during my first scheduled service.  The head unit has trouble managing two separate Bluetooth devices.  I usually use my I-Pod as my Bluetooth Audio Source and my I-Phone 6 as my Bluetooth Phone Source.  The head unit will sometimes get confused and switch these around during start-up without any prompts from me.  The folding exterior mirrors are not easy to fold, it's like they need WD40 or something.  The rain sensing wipers can be too sensitive at times.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " Overall, this is a very nice car.  I like it but don't quite love it, at least yet.  I cross shopped primarily the Mazda 6, Buick Regal turbo, and Honda Accord V6.  I got the TLX with the 2.4L 4-cylinder with 8 speed dual clutch and tech package.   It is a nice, quiet, comfortable, light on its feet 4 door sedan that has a hint of sport and a great audio system.  The TLX won my spreadsheet analysis comparison but hasn't won my heart yet.  I found the 6 and Regal to be sportier and more fun to drive, especially the Regal with the HiPer strut and AWD.  The Accord v6 was a hoot with that sweet v6.  The 6 lost due to aggressive head restraints, a bit more road noise, and it didn't have much top end power.  The Regal lost due to poorer visibility and lower quality interior and switches.  The Accord lost due to aggressive head restraints that gave my wife a headache and the audio system that wasn't up to my audio standards.  For the TLX, my biggest complaint is the transmission mapping.  By 25mph I'm in 5th gear.  Oh my!  I give the car a little gas and it doesn't do anything.  To do anything it needs to downshift a gear or two.  I always feel like it's in a gear too high.  Granted, I am coming from a 2007 TSX 6 speed manual that I had for almost 10 years and loved.  That was a nice driver's car!  Mat Hargett and Bryan Hourt of Acura say this is a red carpet athlete and it's also like a horse you know well that won't tire you out.  Well, I do think they are right to a certain degree.  It CAN be sporty if you put it in sport plus and corner carve a bunch of empty curvy streets and keep the revs high and the transmission in a lower gear.  But I'm so far just commuting and I want it to feel more engaging.  If I just relax and drive in a more relaxed manner, it's more satisfying.  The v6 and SH-AWD v6 version were faster but felt heavier and even less engaging.   My expectations are maybe not in line with today's auto practices.  My old TSX is nearly 10 years old and things have changed a lot since then.  The move from hydraulic to electric steering, going from double wishbone to strut front suspension, and gas mileage maximizing transmission mapping all take their toll on driving fun and engagement.  In the end it was time for a new car and the TLX 4 cylinder was the overall best, I liked it, and it was in budget.  I was just hoping to love it.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I have always been a fan of the Acura TL, and recently went down and test drove the Acura TLX.  I loved it, and ended up buying myself one two weeks later.  For the money this thing is absolutely loaded with features.  Adaptive cruise control, active lane keep assist and the brake hold are great features that make the commute to and from work on a daily basis that much more comfortable.  As others have stated it takes a minute to get the hang of all the controls inside, but once you pick it up they really are quite logical.  You can either use the spin wheel (similar to BMW and Mercedes but up on the dash), or you can use the touch screen to do a lot of things such as navigation and audio.  The stereo is solid and the sub-woofer definitely helps to round it out with solid lows.  Prior to owning the TLX I drove a King Ranch F-150 and I never realized how expensive it was in most cars in this class to get some of the features I have grown accustomed to over time such as air-conditioned seats and remote start.  The Acura TLX provides excellent value for the money and I am really enjoying mine so far.  I would definitely recommend that you check it out if you are looking for a sporty 4-door sedan in the $40,000-$45,000 range.",

I in my opinion that is very intinuative.  It actually make it easier to set those vehicle systems that were so hard to set up in older cars to your personal preference a breeze to set up.  For example, if you dont like to wear out your LED lights cause they keep turning on and off as you approach the vehicle or your door locks un locking when you put your gear in park, or your cabin lights staying on for 10, 150, 30 secs after you close ther door, that is now so easy to setup in that menu system.   On older cars  you have to unlock, lock door twice, turn on , off ignition, turn key on...etc etc just to reset these configurations, now its all in the menu and simple to setup.

So I've been eager for the TLX to come out.  So I was severely disappointed when I test drove the V6 AWD version.  The transmission completely neuters to V6 - seriously, it feels  like a really under powered 4 cylinder.  It has no power when you put the pedal down.  It shifts just just when you think you are going to get in the power curve.  My 4 cyl TSX feels more powerful than this V6.  There is NO WAY I would want this driving in rush hour traffic, when you need the car to quickly react when trying pass or merge into highway traffic.   The steering was...weird.  I've test driven the Lexus IS 350 (V6) and the Volvo S60 (5 Cylinder turbo).  They both had better throttle response and steering.  The Volvo has less HP than the TLX per the numbers, but you wouldn't know it due to the TLX transmission.  The cabin controls are overly complicated.

Interestingly, I just tore the bumper off the front of the car backing out of a parking spot and visited a body shop. We got to chatting that the car was so beautiful but the lights were so bad - and he offered to adjust them. Do you know, he adjusted the lights up half way - and they can be raised additionally - while my Service Manager at Open Road Acura insisted they could not be adjusted. This is infuriating!  The front bumper is so lowto the ground - right after my experience yesterday, while driving home I was next to another TLX same year - and the same bumper was torn -coincidence? I am amazed it tore so easily.The visibility - try looking in your side mirrors without becoming seasick - they are curved. So if you move forward orback and continue looking at mirror - the view moves and stretches.  Why??? Why does the air conditioning vent reflectinto the side mirrors - oh wait, they said it was a recall only the day after my purchase. But I've met other owners who were not given the revised ",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " A great value at its price point. The car is within a whisker of greatness if those responsible for its design would study the competition and take a lesson is usability design.  Sometimes engineers get enamored with themselves .  I should know, I am one.  This car is an unbelievable value at its price point .  I bought it based on that and I don't regret it but it could be the absolute class leader but for a few points:1.  For Petes sakes heat the steering wheel and rear seats.  Comes in the Canadian model.  Is Minnesota warmer than Canada?2.  Please for the love of god sit down with a few customers who have tried to use your cockpit.  It is non intuitive and silly in some respects.  Don't you people ever drive this car?3. I like auto fold mirrors.  So do all the people who buy bmw Audi and Mercedes.  It's stupid but it makes us feel special.  Do it!4.  The nine speed has problems that everybody knows about... Fix it!5. The lane keeping assist and dynamic cruise are good.  Can you stop insisting I move the steering wheel?  Turning it off if I don't seems asinine.  It's like the car is saying ",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " This is my 4th Acura. This doesn't feel like the quality car I have been used to. The ride used to be much sportier and tight whereas now it feels like you float on the road. The safety features are very unreliable. The way to navigate the radio and air has gotten much more difficult and take your focus off the road when using. Pretty sure I won't be getting a 5th Acura.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " A long time Acura owner loved my TL.  Car was totaled and decided to buy a new car between TLX and mazda 6 GT.  I heard the 2015 transmission problem and was told by dealer the problem has fixed.  Searching online found no report on the 2016 model and people talking about the problem has been fixed by updating software (I was wondering if they are hired by acura!!).  I did tested the car I want to buy for 30 min  stop-go many times and noticed nothing (at 65F).  After 400 miles or so the car started to jerk at 0-30 mile/hr at all first 3 gears 80% to time (between 32F to 50F temperature).  Now at 700 miles the car started to jerk when slowing the car from 30 - 0 miles/hr.  What a nightmare to drive the car.  I hope Acura come out a real solution to the issue and fix the problem.",

  "acura_tlx_2016": " Reading some of these reviews, I wonder who writes them.  Honda Motor Company no doubt.  I have been very disappointed in this car which I got 3 months ago.  It has been in the shop 3 times to fix the rough shifting.  In stop and go traffic it is a nightmare.  The mechanic acknowledged they still have many complaints.  It is a software problem.... With  eight gears it can't always decide which gear to go to.   So far no software to fix it.  I've asked for out of my lease but they say no.  I feel stuck with a $400 a month annoying experience.  If they ever fix the problem it will be a pretty good car but the transmission on the 2016 4 cylinder is not ready for prime time yet.",

  "acura_tlx_2016": " Bought a fully optioned TLX V6 with SH-AWD and Advanced package with less than 700 miles on it.  A little history: The vehicle had previously been wrecked leaving the dealership when the teenager driving it rear-ended another car on the freeway.  There was no frame damage and the car was repaired at the Acura dealer back to factory specs.  Since the kid didn't want a car that had been wrecked before and since 'daddy' wrote another check for $50K to buy another new fully loaded TLX, this vehicle was subsequently sold to an independent used car dealer for about 1/2 the MSRP.  Their loss, my gain!This is my 4th Acura and 7th Honda product in recent years and so far I've not been disappointed.  Though Hondas have dominated our car ownership experience, our family has owned various models from Chrysler, Ford, GM, Mercedes and BMW over the years and there's reason we keep going back to Honda. The build quality on this vehicle is excellent by comparison to other models that we've owned, across all manufacturers.  The ride quality is great and the steering feel is good, though still not as good as the 3-series BMW.  The transmission can be a little quirky at times but nothing that's unacceptable. Even though my vehicle was essentially 'new' and I paid almost $15K off MSRP because of the previous wreck, it still would have been a good buy at it's MSRP based on similar cars in the segment with the same features.  Is this car the best in it's segment? No, it's not.  Does it represent the best value in it's segment? Absolutely!",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " The car drove very well with good acceleration.  It would have been on my contender list except for the awkward navigation display.  The car actually has two screens, one a touch screen and the other is a navigation display screen.  The screens take up so much room and the navigation screen is pretty far from the driver...too far to touch and a little tough to see.",

Very comfortable, plenty of power. 9 spd trans takes a little getting used to.Surprised Back up sensor as an add on to the Tech package does not mute radio when placing car into reverse but warning beep is loud enough to not be an issue.This is our 7th Honda/Acura vehicle. I expect nothing less then a smooth and reliable experience.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " Nice Car to drive but less room for seating if tall driver or passenger riding this car.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " Everything is extremely good except for some reason they have the worst tires. Performance would probably be much better with a quality high performance tire.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I have owned Acura cars for over 20 years and this one is the worst. Getting in and out is terrible as the reach to close the door is too far and the seats are too low. You can not see the front of the car so parking head-in is just guess work as you never know how close you are to the wall.  The entertainment system is far too complicated and not easy to use. I never feel comfortable driving the car and wish I had obtained something else. I want my old TSX back. I really hate this mistake of a car.Every time I get in the car I hate it more than the last time. Worst car I ever had. Major mistake.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I traded in my 2013 ilx to buy the 2016 tlx. I could no longer take the road noise on the tlx- my husband and I could hardly have a conversation. The tlx is much quieter- not quiet, but much better.  I was hoping for better gas mileage for a 4 cylinder, 24 mpg  I really like the blind spot warning and the compas / street name at the top of the instrument cluster. The trunk is huge but wish it opened further when poped open. The plastic handle in the trunk for closing is hokey- your supposed to pull it and quickly get your arm out before it hits ya. I like the new headlights but miss the fog lights my tlx had. I was looking for a car that was luxury inside as I drive a lot but wanted good gas mileage and low maintenance expense and am hoping this will be it.  My two prior cars were BMW and I got tired of writing huge checks for repairs and didn't like that people treated me like I was rich or a show off, the Acura to me is less flashy but still nice inside",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I did a lot of research and drove quite a few cars and couldn't find anything that has all the TLX has to offer.  It's comfortable and sporty at the same time.  I love the technology and the ability to stay connected.  For the price the European cars are far behind.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " Test drove a Lexus ES-350, Mercedes C-300 and the Acura TLX V-6 Advance.  The Acura was more spacious inside, it is wider and there is more headroom.  Very quiet interior and the car seems to float over the road.  No problems whatsoever with the 9 speed transmission.  I understand it just took a software update.  I was bothered by too much road noise in the Lexus and the height/head room is tight (plus no sunglass holder!).  The Mercedes C-300 offers a high quality car.  However I found it small inside, particularly the width.  I really like the Acura's separate screen for the navigation and one for the sound system.  The ELS 10 speaker system with surround is wonderful.  I like to just sit in it and listen to my IPod.  The car has very good acceleration and good gas mileage.  There are more technology features than other similar luxury cars.  Plus it is priced lower than the Lexus and Mercedes C-300.  I highly recommend the Acura TLX, particularly the V-6 ",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " This new TLX replaces my 2013 TSX SE. The TSX was a nice enough car with a great interior (tu-tone suede on the SE trim) and a very sporty demeanor. It's negatives outweighed is positives, though, in that it had too choppy of a ride and too much road noise to be truly enjoyable over the long haul. Those shortcomings have long been Acura and Honda traits, but no more! The TLX has a truly quiet and comfortable ride that is well controlled and never truly harsh in any way. The rear steering, or PAW-S, allows compensation for the softer ride in giving back a sharpness to the handling that is equally appreciated. The only weak link in the handling is the stock 17",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " There are higher performance cars out there, as well as ones with more plush interiors.  But for a perfect blend of sportiness, quiet, smooth ride, comfort, tech features and outstanding stereo system, and cost, I found the TLX to be the perfect car for me.  So much intelligence and consideration for the driver went into this car.  I got the 4 cylinder, 2.4 liter, dual clutch 8 speed transmission with Tech Package, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a practical but enjoyable blend of sportiness, luxury, and affordability.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I bought a '16 TLX tech package SH-AWD five weeks ago and since then have put 900 miles on it. At the time I was looking around, there was still plenty of 2015's available that were nicely marked down in price. Hoping to save a few grand, I looked around for the very specific trim package and color combo I wanted an also did all kinds of research. I found that half the reviews were good, and half were bad because of the ZF 9 speed transmission. I was initially disappointed to read so many reviews slamming the car because of it. Understanding that the first model year of any car usually has issues, I considered a 2016 in hopes whatever tranny problems may exist are ironed out. As far as appearance and features go, there is no difference in the 2 model years. I went out and test drove SIX different TLX's (four 2015 and two 2016). The problems many people reported were clunky shifting from gear 2 to 3, downshift hesitation, slow roll take off hesitation, car jerking forward as it downshifts especially when descending down a hill giving the driver the impression the car is speeding up when it should be slowing down. I took special note to almost all the bad reviews saying that the car was fine for the first few hundred miles before it started so one of the 15's I drove was a program car that had 300 miles already on it. What I found was that there is a small learning curve involved with 9 speed transmission but I found no problems with any of the cars I test drove and I was really looking for them. All the upshifts were smooth. Some downshifts required an extra half second to find a gear since it is a 9 speed but nothing crazy like I read some people complaining that they were being put into accident prone situations. While stopped, the start/stop feature which kills the engine does take half a second as well to accelerate because the engine has to turn back on but it is quick doing it all things considered. I'm not sure how much gas it saves in real world but there's nothing gained from sitting still idling either. That feature can be turned off for those who don't like but I find I leave it on unless I'm in a lot of stop and go traffic. Going down a hill is no problem. You can feel the car push forward slightly to downshift wen it engages the clutch and stops engine braking for a split second however it is easy to identify and adds no danger. I don't feel the least bit nervous about it. I felt no difference between the 2015's and '16s. I bought a '16 because I found the black/greystone combination I wanted with the Tech AWD (advance was too expensive and I got the dealer to throw in the remote start anyway). I had the rear lip spoiler and full aero kit put on and the car looks and feels amazing! No tranny issues here. As for everything else, the 4 different driving modes are indeed different. The engine has plenty of power in any of them but eco mode really mutes acceleration response and lightens the steering and suspension a lot. Sport and sport plus mode tightens the steering and suspension (the steering still has a bit of artificial tightening feel when compared to my previous car which handled like a champ, but not a problem at all, just the slightest notice), but the acceleration becomes lighting quick in response and the car is a blast to drive on the highway on the upper end of the RPM range. Forget the paddle shifters with a 9 speed...too much work. If you use one while in sport plus mode, you are stuck continuing to have to use them unless you drop the drive mode to eco or normal. In all other modes, it goes back to full automatic after a few seconds unless you continue to use it. I ignore it but if you like paddle shifters, they do shift well and responsively. MPG's are not as good as listed, I got 247 miles on my first tank in Normal mode and 290 or so on my second tank in ECO mode, driving very easy - it's a 17.5 gallon tank but hey gas is below $2.00. The sound system is absolutely the best stock system I've ever heard - just amazing sound. Haven't figured out yet how to have texts read and replied through the blue tooth but I will be calling the service desk to inquire. Other than that the blue tooth and infotainment is great. Little learning curve with the dual screens but I like them a lot. Acura nailed it with this car!!! Love the looks (subjective I know) and the performance. If you're in the market, do not be put off by the transmission concern, drive a couple and see for yourself, maybe avoid pre-owned or left-over '15s or at least see the build date on the driver side door jam sticker. Anything built after August 2015 should be fine. Go get one, it IS that kind of Thrill !!!!",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " 1) It's more comfort/quiet than sporty, more lexus ES then BMW 3 series. If you looking for a comfortable commuter car to make a few aggressive moves, this care will do the trick just fine. Plan for an extra lag time when you hit petal to the metal, unless you are in sport+ mode. Under all other modes pressing the petal will only accelerate the car slowly in the immediate second.2) more car for the value. Car is almost the size of lexus ES (large midsize), not BMW 3 series (small midsize). It is quiet, It seems to be tune to weed out outside human voice and not so much traffic noise. traffic noise is hush to a very comfortable whisper. You can only hear the wind if you travel faster than 70mph. But not as quiet as top of the line BMW 7 or lexus LS. You hardly tell the difference between going 50mph vs 100mph unti you look at speeddometer. Technology package really adds a lot of value even though it may not seem like it on paper. Lots of standard features even in the base model (LED headlights, rear view camera, heated seats, side mirrors automatically tilt down when in reverse). One of the best audio systems.2) Inexpensive, easy to own, premium fuel is recommended but not required. Buy pre-certified, and get benefits of cheaper price but has full new car warranty + 1 additional year. Maintenance is also cheap thus should buy rather than lease, compared to BMW or Mercedes which basically forces you to lease or sell the car once maintenance warranty runs out.3) Lots of technology and features at much cheaper prices compared to the Germans. standard rearview camera. I really like the 3 views camera (no need for parking sensors with a top down view, where you can see exactly how many inches before the bumper hits the other car). I disagree with some professional reviewers, I prefer the dual screen setup, where I can keep the nav map on top and audio/climate on the bottom screen. Blind spot warning lights are on the inside, not on side mirrors like other cars. The Best lane keeping assist system, though I prefer if it work at low speeds also.  Love the automatic record all CDs while you  place in the car. Insert a CD and by the time you listening to the 3rd track, it has recorded the entire CD, so you never have to re-insert the CD again. Back seats fold down. Great night time ambient lighting. Lots of interior storage places.4) Interior is Not quite full luxury experience. Very 2010 luxury feel than 2015-2016. No panoramic sun roof. Clean look, but no contrasting color scheme. Not all panels are leather or wood-like. Some use of soft plastics, hard plastic for the door trays. Lumbar support doesn't have height adjustment. No sun shades, only highest trim has cooling seats, heated steering wheel,  and puddle lights. Overall TLX is a best value for the features and well rounded car with low maintenance cost. It not the best performance nor the best comfort luxury.",
  "acura_tlx_2016": " I drove both the 4 and 6 cylinder.  I bought a 2016 4 cylinder tech. The 8 speed dual clutch on the 4 cylinder is a great transmission. A little rough shifting when very cold, but once it warms up it is a dream.  Heard too many negative things about the 9 speed transmission on the V6 model. The 4 has plenty of pick up and go, but is no race car. It meets my needs. Very quiet cabin, smooth ride. Front tires do spin easily on wet roads, from a stop. I think better tires then the Goodyear standard equipment could help here.  Only issue I have is that I cannot click over to any call waiting calls while on bluetooth.  I have an I phone 6s. My telematics unit may be bad.  Or could be a widespread software issue. Awaiting a service visit to confirm.  Otherwise no issues.

Great decision the 4 cylinder has tremendous power even though I thought long and hard about going w the 6, the technology package is definitely worth the extra bucks for all the safety features and technology that comes w it. Absolutely love this car all the way around",

If you want ostrich covered upholstery and a vehicle that drives itself, this probably is not for you. But if you want a car that has all the necessary luxury items and is fun to drive, try the TLX.

When she told me how much she paid for it, I thought she was confused and made her show me the purchase contract.  She paid a little over 30 for the base model.  You cannot get a car like this for the money.  People that complain about the acceleration need to learn how to drive.  The 4 cylinder has more horse power than a Toyota Camry.  When you are passing or merging you floor it to make it down shift to use all 204hp.  My normal car is an infiniti G37 (330hp).  I floor the infiniti about once a week and floored the acura two or three times a day.  I paid about 45 for my infiniti with all the bells and whistles.  My car has some features that the acura doesn't have but it has some that mine doesn't.  The acura has no gas cap and shows the tire pressure for each individual tire just to name a few.

The car still vibrates around 75 MPH, but less intensively.  Just  improve a little bit. I have driven four TLX V6 AWD from dealer, every of them vibrates.  My neighbor has a  TLX AWD V6 with tech package too, his car vibrates around 75 MPH too.  This time Acura made very bad car.   Acura client relation is terrible.

However, I do wish I had purchased  the sport seats. Had the car for about 10 days and went on a road trip of 600 miles. Gas mileage was as advertised at 30-31 mpg. Ran it up to 110mph and it had a great deal more to give. The steering takes a little getting use to as it is so responsive. Have had numerous compliments.",

It has a lot of cool features like auto wipers, collision warning, and headlights that light up the corners when you start a turn. The Harmon Kardon speakers sound great.  The tech package is very simple, but it works really well and takes no time to master.  My guess is while it's more basic it's probably going to be better than most systems that they try to force too many features in and they are glitchy. Slam on the breaks and the car stays flat, zero noise drive.  The quality is top notch, not single defect or rattle. Only had it for a few weeks - really hoping the reliability is there too. The front sport seats are a tad hard and seem to be built for smaller people. The shifter is taking some time to get used to. That's about all I can find on the downside.",

  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " Purchased a used A3 e-Tron lease turn in a little over a month ago with 3300 miles. This is my first Audi. It is a very nice car, and so far a good value, especially since the used price reflects the first owners receiving federal and state tax credits. The car is very quiet, comfortable, handles well and efficient. I only have limited access to plug in charging, so I charge it about 3 times per week. With a full charge I normally get 13-17 miles on pure EV mode and in hybrid mode average about 41MPG. The last tank combining 4 plug in charges and a full tank, it averaged just over 51 mpg with mixed hwy (75%)/city (25%) driving. Its not the EPA advertised 83mpgE, but is what I expected based on the reviews I read. I agree as other reviewers have said, if your daily commute is over the pure EV range, just put it in hybrid mode to maximize your plug in charges. The ability to select charge mode at the end a long trip to use EV mode for city commuting, a feature that I heard was discontinued on the 2017 model is also a plus. I also like the clean simpleness of the interior layout and minimizing of buttons, especially the placement of the radio on/off/volume/track select button on the lower console. This car has the adaptive cruise control and pre collision braking, both which are awesome and worth the extra price! The items which I am not so impressed with are the B,O sound system and Audi Connect. The sound system is adequate, but lacks the bass response that my other vehicles have (Bose). The e-tron does not offer memory seats/mirrors which was disappointing since it was the highest Prestige trim level. I still cannot get the Audi Connect App to fully work after talking with the courteous and helpful Audi phone people twice. It wont push directions to the NAV and wont display all the Audi Connect features, nor remotely turn on the A/C. The Nav screen is adequate, but frustrating at times to use the wheel interface to input destinations. Since this car is new tech for VW/Audi, I would recommend purchasing the extended warranty and prepaid maintenance plans. Overall, I am satisfied with the car.",

  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " We bought this car for my wife. She's wanted a plug-in electric as she has driven hybrids since 2007. We looked at the e-tron and the Volt. She was impressed with the Volt but after driving the e-tron, she said there was no comparison. She has never stated that a car was fun to drive. She did after driving the Audi. To her a car is an appliance.  There is compromises with the e-tron particularly wit the range.  In our case my wife has a 5 mile commute to work.  The 16 miles of electric is sufficient. So far, she has ranged from a low of 16 miles, (90+ degrees out, AC running non-stop) to 23 miles (70 out, minimal AC). On a trip from our home in Hershey Pa to Charlottesville, VA we ran it on hybrid mode and got 42 mpg. Other than that road trip, she's not needed gas. It's been 4 weeks since we last filled it, driven 400 miles and it's still on Full. If the etron fits your needs - buy it! If you need more range, then the Volt is an excellent car too. In our case, with a short daily commute, the Audi is a perfect fit. With discounts, credits etc. we are in for $37k on the Audi versus $35k for the Volt. But we got power seats , moon roof for that difference in price.Update - We took a road trip from Hershey PA to Hackettstown, NJ.  Approx. 100 mi. each way.  We averaged 45 mpg running in Hybrid mode.  We've now learned all the nuances of the selectable driving modes.  For road trips, we put it in Hybrid mode to optimize the gas/electric mileage.  For the daily commute, she leaves it in the default EV (electric only) and runs without the gas engine.  Great car that fits our needs perfectly!",

  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " Our 2016 Audi A3 e-tron has had to go back to the dealer twice within a month for different issues. The first time the check engine light came on, it was a cooling pump issue. The second time it was an emissions control problem. The dealer supplied us with a much more costly A6 Quattro loaner each time, but we missed our car as it took nearly a week each time for the repairs to be done. Why? The dealer had to order parts from Germany. Apparently U.S. dealers have not received a lot of the parts needed to do anything beyond ordinary maintenance. Also, when the service department is busy, it can take two days just to find out what's wrong. I'm sure glad they have loaners.",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " I've been looking at this car very seriously for about a month, and with interest for about 4 months.  I have taken two test drives of the 2016 model and done lots of online research as well.   It is ",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " I sold my VW Jetta sportwagon TDI (which I loved) to take advantage of newer technology and safety features.  It took me a couple tanks of gas to figure out how to use the computer system...but now that I understand, the results have been very impressive.  I'm in sales and spend a lot of time on the highway...which is not the best place for a hybrid, but my fuel economy is still 40% better than my diesel.  If I'm taking a short trip, I leave the computer in the default EV mode.  Otherwise, I immediately put the system in the hybrid mode and the computer does a very effective job of balancing the battery and engine use.  With about 5,000 miles on my car, I've been averaging 58 miles per gallon (with a lot of highway driving)....about 20 mpg better than my diesel.  If you only drive highway miles, a hybrid might not be the best choice...but if you're like most people, a hybrid does an amazing job.  This week I've done mostly local driving and I'm averaging around 74 mpg.",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " My last two cars were a 2002 Lexus IS300 sport sedan and a 2008 Prius, and the Audi A3 Etron blends and exceeds the best of both those vehicles.  Handling, acceleration, and comfort are excellent, and I have averaged almost 100 mpg over the first two months of ownership.  And it is by far the best looking of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle hatchbacks currently available in NC.  All two of them.",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " This is my first Audi and first plugin. While there are some things that aren't perfect (I'm looking at you radio/climate system), overall this is a very pleasing car.Who buys this thing? Gas is cheap at the time of this review, so you don't buy an Audi plugin to save money, exactly. Who buys it then is someone who likes the handling and style of the Audi and is willing to pay a bit more for it, but still wants to do the environment a good turn. I doubt they'll sell a lot of these.Still, for me, this car fit the bill. And I'm overall quite pleased. I've had it 2 months and still have over half the original tank of gas in it. I'm averaging around 270 MPG. I do that by managing how I drive and making sure to arrange things to drive on electric as much as I can. This clearly is not something everyone will want to do. For shorter trips and my daily commute, I run all EV. For longer trips, I put it into hybrid mode from the start and let the car decide when to use the battery. Performance: hate to disappoint performance enthusiasts, but I've never floored the car. I bought it for a reason and I stick to that. I have hit it harder in EV mode when I pulled out and misjudged the distance of the car coming. It went to around 60% and I was frankly shocked at the acceleration. This is because when you're driving it 'normally,' it seems to be tuned so that it feels weak. But noooooo, noooo, it's not weak. Cornering-wise, this thing is beyond awesome, but that's coming from a guy who has driven non-Audis before. Hey, it helps my MPG to go around corners without braking, right?I have two main complaints, mainly with the controls. Why can't I switch radio stations without taking my eyes off the road? Seriously, there are like 18 radio controls and they all require me to look at one of two LCD displays. Sorry, but I miss being able to hit button #3 and know that I'll get a certain station. They un-invented that. Second, there seems to be no way to just let clean air vent into the car in the winter. For a plugin, this does make a difference. Using the heater costs me miles. When it's not THAT cold out, I'd rather just vent rather than have a choice between a) fogged windows and b) use my battery to get the vent temp up.If you're looking for a racecar, why are you even reading this? if you're looking for the best plugin hybrid, you should probably go see a Volt. But if you are looking for a way to do a good turn for the environment, to do it in style, and to have some pep when you want to let it loose, this car is worth a look. Is it a good value? Depends. Mine cost around $35K after the Fed rebate. This puts in territory of normal small luxury cars and normal plugin hybrids. I'm not sure I'm 'saving' money exactly with this car, but I am pleased I bought it.",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " We are long term Audi owners.  We traded in the infamous A3 TDI and own A4, A5 and TT.  Honestly, the TDI was a great car.  Too bad it was spewing so much pollution and worse, Audi lied about it by calling it ",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2016": " This 2016 A3 e-tron drives like a proper Audi. My previous car was a 2006 A3 Sportback, the first generation A3 in the US shores. This new car's driving dynamics is very similar to that car, which is a good thing. I do wish that Audi gave it a larger battery because driving in all electric EV mode in this car is very quiet and very satisfying. The 1.4 engine when it turns on is also quiet and more than capable. There were a few internet connection hiccups in the beginning with the e-tron connect service, but that eventually got sorted out.Update:With the warmer months approaching, I'm now able to consistently drive between 20-22 all electric miles (the on board computer usually reads 25-28 AER). The e-tron drives fantastic with just the electric motor. Audi made the right choice by giving it enough juice (85 kW) to pull away from traffic lights and freeway on-ramps on electric power alone. Selecting Hybrid Auto or Sport mode (Hybrid Hold), a driver has access to all 204 HP and 260 ft-lb of torque. One pedal driving with strong regeneration is possible with Sport mode or manual mode on the Tiptronic.e-tron connectivity service can sometimes hiccup. But I believe this is due to Verizon Telematic's finicky signal that is built-in to every e-tron.",
  "audi_a3-sportback-e-tron_2017": " This car is awesome in ev mode. Very quiet with excellent acceleration. It's even better in sport mode using the gas and electric engines. In hybrid mode, anytime you lift off the gas the engine shuts down, the car coasts effortlessly . There is a little engine noise on the highway but not too bad. Engine restart is quiet and vibration free. Sport seats are very comfortable with four way lumbar adjustments. Once you figure out the menus, bt connection with streaming works flawlessly. I only wish that there was more than about 23 miles in ev mode.",
  "audi_a3_2016": " After having BMWs to Audis (I even did a brief stint in a honda accord, yuck) I found this to be the most likable. I loved my a4 and s4, but due to older age, needed something brand new, didn't want to sacrifice acceleration or comfort. The a3 is noticeably smaller than the a4 of today, same size as the a4 of previous generations. My wife and I fit up front perfectly and comfortably and my 100lb lab in the back. Plenty of trunk space. What attracts me is the fact that it still feels almost as fast as my b8 s4, with the fuel economy that doesn't hurt the wallet. Really the only downside is getting black, I was her a lot. I urge any and everyone to just take a test drive, Great commuter car, fantastic weekend car to the country with the wonderful panoramic sunroof. Skip the nav, your iPhone can do everything anyways. Do get an upgraded stereo. I have basic (audi concert) it sucks when i want to jam I have it turned almost 85-90. Get bose or B,O.",
  "audi_a3_2016": " This is my first Audi. I had a VW Polo before that I really loved and this Audi rides even better (sure more power, better transmission....). My biggest concern about this car is the transmission while maneuvering. most specifically when shifting from Reverse to Drive, it always makes a funny noise and you can feel that something went wrong. After a while you get used to it and if you are patient enough to wait 3 seconds it wont happen. I was really surprise that nobody reported this issue on the previous reviews. Different from what most people say about not using the back seat, I have a 19 months baby that loves to ride with the top down. Yes, space is limited but you have to keep that in mind and use a larger car on longer trips. The quality of the materials are SUPERB!! Everything is extremely easy to use and perfectly located. Driving it on back roads is an awesome and relaxing experience. The short wheelbase, powerful engine and excellent suspension makes you feel like you are driving a Formula 1. It hugs the asphalt on every curve and the feedback from the steering wheel is outstanding. This is my 2nd year with the car and I'm loving everything about it.",
  "audi_a3_2016": " This is a fantastic car with a fatal flaw: vibration.  I'm not talking about the normal ",
  "audi_a3_2016": " CD should be like the A5. Putting it inside the glove compartment is poor.  The blind or land change light is excellent !!!!   The change to your songs is poor. This too should be put in your glove compartment not in the instrument next to your hand.  That part should be open to keys etc.  My A5 was far better !!!",
  "audi_a3_2016": " I was worried going from an A4 to an A3 but for the value I got for the price this car is perfect! Carlsbad Audi is awesome to work with.",
  "audi_a3_2017": " Many trim levels to choose from.  Pays to go up one level for power to both front seats and even Navigation.  No memory seat available for Premium trim.  Great  engine,.  Start stop engine technology still has issues  fro some reason.  Can disable it .",
  "audi_a3_2017": " I own this car less than a month so ratings for some items are N/A. No memory seats combined with smaller door openings make getting in and setting up a little inconvenient. The AWD eats up 2-3 CF of trunk space. Car is very well made. Layout of controls is very logical - European logical, and that is a good thing. Best feature - Virtual cockpit. All my nav, media, and car info can also be displayed and controlled independently in front of me in addition to the Nav screen in the center. The center Nav screen retracts into the dash which is better than the more expensive BMW, and Mercedes which have an afterthought I-Pad glued onto the dash. I recommend this car",
  "audi_a4-allroad_2017": " This car is a joy to drive.  The composure and sure footedness is impressive at any speed.  Going a wee bit :) over the speed limit and you will not know how fast you are going.  Thank goodness for the head up display on the Prestige trim.  This is a silent and stealth car for those of us who are looking to do some spirited driving and get the children to school.  The quiet cabin is amazing as well.  Enjoying every drive!",
  "audi_a4-allroad_2017": " This car is by far the perfect fusion of performance, practicality and technology. Drive select gives you two different flavor of driving, dynamic being stiffer, comfort being softer, and it was more than capable when traveling through mountains or highways. More space than you possibly imagine, huge cargo, very comfortable second row (don't look, sit on and you know what I am talking about). Length is the same with SUVs like Lexus RX 350, only with lower ride height, giving substantially better driving pleasure. Technology wise I don't know a car better than this except tesla, definitely better than current BMW (2017). Combination of advanced lane assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist almost make this car driveless, removing most of driving pressure, but still in practical level (you have the control instead of the car itself). Luxury interior, fantastic lighting and high quality inlay and leather. Only one complaint is that it is not as sporty and stiff as some of the sport coupe, but I guess I can't put all hope onto the same car:)",
  "audi_a4-allroad_2017": " This is a fabulous car. Enough room to haul my dogs in crates. My 2006 Audi S6 just sits in the garage now. The turbo has no lag and the car is almost as quick and agile as my S6.",
  "audi_a4_2016": " I rented an Audi A4 wagon in Europe for a week and drove around 1000 miles in it. Overall it is a great vehicle, comfortable, engine response is prompt, transmission is flawless, ride is quiet, steering is sharp. For negatives I would note the complexity and lack of intuitiveness of the infotainment system, using their GPS was taking too long to set on a destination and I kept using my TomTom. I guess it takes time to learn how to use it, same with toggling with the map display in the central area between the speed and tachometer. Also at low speeds the brake looses linearity and suddenly locks the wheels if you press a little harder. Also getting in and out of the car is a bit uncomfortable. But the overall impression is great, you don't even know when you get to pass everyone, the car is still quiet and seems so effortless.",
  "audi_a4_2016": " I just had the misfortune of renting this car for a week.  Wow, what a joke.I had the base model with the S-Line package and a few extras like navigation.The car was wholly unpleasant to drive.  The CVT an obvious annoyance, the interior, instrumentation and controls utterly mediocre and old fashioned.  It wasn't antiquated like a Subaru, but it seemed like a step down from even a VW, which is inexcusable for the cost.Everything about the driving experience made me completely puzzled as to why anyone would cross shop with this a similarly priced BMW 3 Series and pick this Audi.I'm not a BMW fanboy or anything, but the two vehicles are incompatible in driving experience, and yet they are about the same price.  Audi is supposed to be the premium arm of VW, and yet frankly this car is so easily bested in this segment by so many alternatives.Thank goodness that the 2017 model is a complete redesign.",
  "audi_a4_2016": " End Up leasing the car, but your info helped to make decision. Thanks!",
  "audi_a4_2016": " My car is an A4 Quattro premium S-Line. It stickered just shy of the $50k mark. If I wasn't able to get a smoking deal on it I would have never bought it. Sure, it's pretty. Sure, people go ",
  "audi_a4_2016": " After 11 years, my beloved A4 passed on to another plane of existence. I had always planned to buy another Audi when the time came. I didn't buy this car because for some reason, this Audi can't do what my much less expensive VW can do. I want to connect my phone to my car via Bluetooth and not only get phone calls but also my music, Waze, Spotify etc., to play through the speakers. I can't do this in the Audi unless I purchase the much more expensive package or plug my phone in.. to a cord... in the glove box. No. Just no. Also, CVT transmissions are crap and forced me into a more expensive Quattro to avoid them. Who doesn't want to feel the car shifting? Who likes CVT transmissions?! Also, the back seats don't fold down, there's not even a ski sack like my 2005 had. So, there's no option for a bit more room.  I did not buy the Audi. I wanted so badly to buy the Audi but I just couldn't do it. I bought a Mercedes-Benz instead. I'm hoping Audi gets it right in the next several years.",
  "audi_a4_2016": " Not one of the easiest cars to get in and out from both sides of the car. Consistently hit my head or the door post. Once in the car it was great. I'm average height. Someone taller or bigger would struggle It's the main reason I did not get this car",
  "audi_a4_2016": " Very disappointed with steering.  On straight roads and at speeds over 60mph the car is ALL over the road.  You will need to work hard on a long trip to keep it on track.  I had the car brought in right away to Princeton Audi.  The result,  they said that the steering is within correct limits.  My conclusion is this is either a very poor design by Audi or Princeton Audi Service is incapable of correcting the problem.  My advice, make sure to test drive at speed over 60mph before purchasing.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " Excellent design inside the cabin and exterior- good materials and quality. The tech is top of the class but if you enjoy driving this is not the car for you. Too often on long trips and such will behave like a fwd vehicle, the steering sucks even with the sport package (no way to fix that dead on center Audi feel- it's not old Lincoln bad by any means but not in league with Mercedes' , BMW's, Cadillac's, etc...) , the suspension is not close to what the three series has (I even opted for the adaptive one) - this has been the most disappointing car for me that I have ever purchased -mainly because I want to love it as it is the only one that checked all the boxes on what I wanted (tech features , bang and olufsen sound system, top safety pick, great real world fuel economy, love the looks, etc) Driving around town it can be a lot of fun but if you aren't constantly pushing the car then it loses any illusion of a sporting nature and becomes a very bland drive. If they could get it to have the road manners it does when pushed all the time then it would be an awesome vehicle , just disappointing otherwise.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I'm loving the car so far.  Imho it's the best value in the small luxury sport sedan class this year.   I have the premium plus trim and it has almost everything you would want.  But if you want all possible safety features you will need to step up to the prestige trim. Also the interior LED lights that allow you to change color is only on the prestige, the premium plus has only the white interior LED lights.  Some web sites say the car is slow off the line... I haven't noticed.  It feels amazingly smooth and easily goes 0-60 in 5 secs.   Also some sites have dinged the car for non responsive steering and again I disagree.  The car feels nimble and smooth weaving in and out of traffic.  My previous car was a 6 cylinder Infiniti g35 this car feels faster and more agile and does 10mpg better fuel efficiency.  I did one long trip out the car on comfort ride and did 33mpg averaging around 75 mph.   One thing I think could be better is the engine auto off... It's very noticable and the car feels like its stalling .   It can be shut off but I assume it will effect fuel economy.",

  "audi_a4_2017": " Leased this car. 15 days into it I love it!    Pros -- nice and intuitive controls and excellent MMI interface.  Good interior.  Fun and comfortable driving (compared to my old Camry).     Cons - slight lag during acceleration and wish back seat with little more roomier.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " Great all around car with great balance of performance and comfort. Terrific technology too.",

  "audi_a4_2017": " Loved my Lexus and Infiniti cars, but the A4 tops them both. I can't review reliability yet, as I've only had the car for a month. My brother loved mine so much that he bought one the next week. Extra bonus: getting an average of 30 mpg and my insurance actually went DOWN $400 a year, presumably because of all the safety features in the car.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " Yes, it's that good. I owned the current generation Passat, but traded it in a few years ago for a 328i. I loved the beemer and always missed the Passat for its all around good road manners and build quality. Needless to say the Audi is a finer automobile than the Passat with similarities. This is our 3rd Audi in 10 years. They are underrated. This is as good as it gets for a mid sized sedan. And it's design, inside and out is classic and practical, and will look good on the road for years. The new generation should have had a little more standout change. You will be very pleased with your gas mileage. Once you buy a German made vehicle you will find it difficult to settle for anything else.....in my opinion.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I had a '13 BMW 320i with Dinan Stage 1 and M Sport(with 6speed manual). It was really a fun car, with enough power and great dynamics. Since I was getting older, and my wife needed an automatic and was sitting in traffic a lot, we decided to get an automatic with more linear power(read I6/V6). Shopped around for Lexus IS350 and BMW 340i. 340i was good, but moving from manual to automatic, I didn't find the transmission react fast enough for my tastes. IS350 with its 8-speed transmission was also not as responsive. So I started looking for vehicles with dual-clutch given faster shift times and better response. Audi A4 is one of the few cars in the market with 7 speed DCT in the price range and new 2.0T motor is torque rich and in fact I found the vehicle better than sportier S3. Also even the base trim(Premium) has the Android Auto/Apple Play combo negating the need for nav package(mine has Convenience package, which is a must-have). And Quattro with rear-bias is another feature worth paying for. All in all, I got almost 5K off sticker on a brand-new vehicle which is a way better deal than BMW 328i(RWD),  Lexus IS300(AWD) and Acura TLX-V6 SH-AWD which are way out of Audi's league in terms of responsiveness and ride quality. Handling is little better in BMW, but everything else is dated. Previous Audis never impressed me, but this vehicle is quite a revelation and definitely worth considering if you are in market for entry level sporty-luxury sedans. At least until Lexus and BMW move to next generation, Audi seems to the best all-rounder in the segment.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I bought the prestige over the premium because i wanted the driver assist option. i compared to Bmw 3 and 4 series and Mercedes c class. Audi was my preferred choice for overall driving experience and amenities. The driver assistance program is very good if you have to do a lot of driving in congested traffic - takes a bit of getting used to but very helpful",
  "audi_a4_2017": " This car is the best combination of value, luxury and sportiness in this segment.  The performance is surprising given the comfort and luxury.  The cost is competitive when factoring in all that you get.  A must drive if you are looking for an entry-level sport-luxury car.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " This is my first Audi.  Before buying I drove a BMW 328i xdrive and a Mercedes c class.  They were all very nice cars but I fell for the Audi and love it.  Most of the complaints that I read are about the shifter and the way you have to put it in Park, but I think that Audi got that right.  It is easy and intuitive.  I don't understand the people that complain about it.  It works so much better than the conventional system.  It is so quiet inside.  The ride is fantastic.  Handles great.  My son borrowed it for a couple days.  He told me that on his way home from work he found himself taking the longest route available so he could just drive it longer.  It's the first car I've had that when I have nothing to do, I just take it and go for a drive.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " In 2011, I was beginning to look around for a new car, I liked what I drove, but no longer needed a mini-van or a crossover.  Test drove a BMW and a Ford.  The Expedition wasn't any thing special, and the BMW salesman was so snooty that wouldn't have bought a soda from him.  My husband suggesting looking at the Audi dealership.  I wasn't too thrilled, he had a 1985 Audi when we first married, and it wasn't very reliable.  Imagine my surprise when I test drove a 2012 Q5.  It was fabulous, never had any trouble with it, decent gas mileage and was fun to drive.  After 4.5 years with my Q5 I felt like it was time to trade it in while I had a lot of equity in it (Retained its value very well )  The new A4 was just starting to be talked about.  I test drove one of the first ones my dealership got, and feel in love.  It handles exceptionally well, I can zip around those land yachts!  I am equally impressed with the gas mileage - about 30 mpg in mixed trips.  It is a different feeling getting in a car lower than a SUV, but I have gotten used to it.  Very pleased with this model.",

  "audi_a4_2017": " After owning 3 Acura's in the past 12+ years, I've now had my 2017 A4 Premium Plus for about a month now. The shifter is confusing but this car is such a dream to drive, I'm long past it. So far, with 2K miles on the car, my long term average is over 32 MPG.  Put this baby into sport mode and the 7 speed automated manual transmission will put a smile of your face every time! The sound system is amazing and the cockpit is whisper quiet. The virtual cockpit makes this one of the coolest, most advanced interiors on the market This is my first 4 cyl car in a long time and I'm completely impressed!  I drove every competitor before choosing this and nothing could compare.  I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this beauty.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I can't believe Audi came up with this Aluminum thing.  When the sun hits it, it gets so glaring.  And of course, around midday, the sun will surely hit it because the Audi design is so aerodynamic.  This Aluminum thing reminds me of a similar design that Honda came up with about 12 years ago for its Civic.  That was glaring too.  But Honda dropped it.   But Audi caught it and put it on its A4??  So I recommend paying extra for the dark wood or brown wood.  About everything else, A4 is completely redesigned.  I'm quite happy.  I may write an update in 6 months.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I have always been interested in owning an A4.  The new 2017 A4 prestige meets my vehicle requirements at this time.  It is sporty, fun to drive, packed with safety features and looks great!  My A4 has the  head up display, sport, technology,  and warm and cold weather package.  The interior is trimmed with burl wood and the door exit lighting includes the Audi beam ring projectors.  The virtual cockpit is awesome!!!!!  It consists of google maps and google earth.  Gas mileage is very good.    Audi packed a lot of technology into the 2017 A4.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I've had my 2017 A4 quattro Prestige for 3 weeks now. I love this car. First time I've had an Audi I'm coming out of a 2014 BMW 428i coupe. This car is light years ahead of the BMW in terms of technology. The car my dealer had on the lot had the full tech and driver assistance packages. I wasn't planning to get all of these features but I got a great price on the car and I do love the features. The heads-up display is awesome. I love the highly customizable LED interior lighting too. The virtual cockpit along with large center screen are so amazingly clear and easy to use. I love how well thought out the graphics are. The fit and finish inside is very good everything from the paint finish to the seams inside and out. No rattles or anything. The front seats (which my car has the warm weather package and in Florida that's a must) are very comfortable. Love the design, headlights, tail lights, grille, wheels on my Prestige with gray/silver 2 tone. This car looks so sharp, literally. If I had to give anything that could use improvement, and this is really hard, I'd say: the bang and olufsen stereo doesn't sound as good as my Harman Kardon system in my BMW. I've played with the sound settings and when playing certain songs on the radio there's a 'tinny' sound to mid and high tones I can't get rid of. Only other thing is the sport seat any model has the side bolsters on the lower cushion are hard to come into contact with while entering the car. I hope over time these don't show premature wear and tear. But, as a 6'3",
  "audi_a4_2017": " so far, so good.  I got the S-Line, Premium Plus package and am very happy with it.  Quality it top notch inside and out.  No issues at all, though I've only had it for a month and about 1500 miles.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I am brand new to Audi. I recently just purchased the all new A4 back in May. This car is a total blast to drive! I couldn't be any happier with the performance and quality.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " Impressive technology, interior design, and ride quality with silent interior at speed.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " I test drove a lot of cars (3-series, C300, GLC, XC60, Mazda6, Mini Clubman) before choosing the 2017 A4 and so far, I really enjoy the car. Right now, I think it offers the best mix of tech, performance and luxury in the class, at least until the next 3-series or whatever leapfrogs it. Pros: - The tech goodies are really impressive. Virtual Cockpit is fantastic and having the nav right in front of you in a huge display is actually very useful. It's easy to learn the basic functions of the infotainment system, but it is worth the time to dig deeper and really understand all the different ways you can customize the experience. It makes the car a lot more enjoyable. Even with all the tech, the usability is much better than Mercedes and Lexus. Honestly, you really need to get the technology package to get the best out of this car. - Beyond the gadgets, this is a very good driver's car. Acceleration and braking are very strong, especially with quattro. The ride is firm but controlled. The steering is lighter than I would prefer though. - The interior is not as rich as the C-Class and the GLC, but the materials are high quality, visibility is excellent and the look is very clean and modern. I am 6'2",
  "audi_a4_2017": " First of all, let me tell you that I loved driving my 2013 BMW 328xi, it was a fully loaded sports edition car, loved the acceleration, handling and looks! my only issue with it are the run flat tires that after 30K miles starter making a noise comparable to a bad bearing, but even with that, since my lease was coming to an end, the shopping began and I was certain I was going to get another BMW.Although this time was not as crazy to get the fully loaded version since there where soooooo many features that I've never used and just payed for them any ways, this time around I was just looking for the car with the features I enjoy: Moon roof, sports wheels, heated seats, leather interiors, and that is it. Obviously, BMW car dealers only had cars with most of the high end stuff and even that we were able to find the right car, the price tag was high since wanted to stick to the 240 Hp of the 328 vs the 180hp of the 320.My wife owns an Audi Q5 and we happened to be in the dealer for a service and started to look around the brand new Audi A4 and learned about the upgrades on the design and technology and fell in love with the new car.This model comes with a 252hp engine, 0-60 in 5.8 sec and driving modes that made me forgot my intentions to buy another BMW.Some of the Pros that I see vs BMW:1. Tires (of course)2. Value. you get a 328 kind of performance with a 320 price tag3. Car play. Love the integration with your smart phone4. Space.5. The premium model it was perfectly packed to my needs, only thing I didn't need but is included is the rear view camera and got a credit for its cost!6. More comfortable than the BMW. Although sporty, it rides extremely well!The only minor thing that I have notice is that there is a little bit of reaction time when you press the accelerator, but once is going is pretty amazing.3 years ago I test drove an A4 before getting my 328 and there were not even close, and while purist may say that BMW performance is better I will say that you get 95% of the BMW with 85% of the cost which to me is a pretty good value for your money",
  "audi_a4_2017": " First off, the car is great. I have put on a couple thousand miles and have been pretty happy so far. I do have a few gripes. I'm coming from a 2008 RAV4 so this is my baseline. Glove box is very small. Yes there is a CD player in there but still...it's kind of worthless for storage. That said, storage is pretty much non-existent. The RAV4 has a bunch of compartments for all my stuff. The A4 has nothing other than the glove box. No sunglasses holder. I can't put a large Gatorade bottle in the cup holder unless I put it upside down. My RAV has a removable rubber cup holder insert so I can put the bigger bottle in it. Side pockets are small as well. The interior is otherwise well done. Gas mileage is great. Performance is excellent. Stock tires are quiet but do not seem very grippy when pushing it.Overall very happy with my purchase, albeit with a couple of complaints.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " The new A4 is not flashy.  But it is luxurious and competent.  Steering is precise, braking excellent, and power is more than sufficient.  The car is a joy to drive - quiet and comfortable.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " A complete redesigned A4 reaches new levels of technology and luxury.  The technology in this winner is state of the art.  I almost feel like I need to go back to school and get an IT degree to get the most out of this amazing vehicle.  Apple Car Play works like a charm the minute you plug into the designated USB port in the glove box.  For you Android people it also handles Google Play (or whatever the comparable technology is named).  The ability to load the Nav system where you would normally find your speed and RPM dials gives you the feel that you are the pilot in a 747.  Speaking of the Nav system it is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned or system used.  That includes Honda, Acura and Garmin.   So many electronic gadgets that I urge you to check out this magnificent machine online.   I am also surprised at how well it does on mpg -- I got 31.5 on highway driving.  I'm sure that will even improve on a longer trip.  Very pleased with this purchase.  My sales rep at Audi Natick, Kevin Schuster, was great.  Only drawback is it takes premium fuel, but with this high performance engine it's worth it.  The 2017 A4 is a winner in every way.",
  "audi_a4_2017": " The new A4 design is a redesigned automobile based somewhat on the Audi Q7 cabinet.  Audi was smart enough to keep somewhat of the same exterior design. They were smart enough to add technology to the interior cabinet in place of big outside body changes.   With that said, the inside cabinet has totally changed - for the BETTER. There is more room and comfort, better placement of hand controls, a well-placed cup holder, and three very smart user display areas across the center console, driver dashboard, and windshield .  Compared to the previous model, it is a comfortable rocketship with added safely technology and conveniences surrounding the entire cabinet, including the heated back seats.  The only big drawback is the Apple CarPlay needs to be connected via a cable and not via wireless bluetooth. Yes, we are Apple iPhone users.  Another concern is BMW, Mercedes, and other car manufacturers moving away from Apple, since they are supposedly building their own car line. My questions are: will Audi stay up-to-date with Apple upgrades and changes, or move away?  And even if they stay with Apple or Android, can these new designs - Apple CarPlay and their GPS accept a software upgrade?   In regards to the new A4, I would recommend it.  The changes are enough to get me to the showroom. Hats off to the online marketing department.  In regard to price, it is pricer with all the new option stuff. In closing, I will probably buy one in June because my wife loves her A4, I love her, and it's time to trade up.   Good luck with the car hunting!",
  "audi_a5_2016": " Not a lot of backseat room. Leave the kids at home.",
  "audi_a5_2016": " German engineering at its best.  The Audi is a smooth handling car with great looks. The technology is first class and intuitive.  It does take a little time to gain mastery. It was a good bargain as well. I recommend it highly.",
  "audi_a5_2016": " This is my first time owning a luxury vehicle so I can only compare it based on my test drives of competition. Overall very impressed with the vehicle. Car has incredible grip of the road while taking a turn. Acceleration is superb, and torque comes in handy when overtaking on the highway. I got the premium plus with tech package so it came with bang and olufsen sound system that has fantastic sound quality. Only small complaint is the navigation, compared to my last vehicle it's a bit confusing when it comes to desalting turns, especially when making complicated mirages in the city. Over all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " I am 40 this year, a single mom, successful with a 7 yr old boy. This car is so safe, sexy, fast and comfortable! My heart skips a beat every time I see it!",
  "audi_a6_2016": " I got this car all excited by the Audi name. First, the engine is very loud, even when you close the windows you can still hear the engine, comparing it to my wife's MB E350, huge difference. The ride is rough, even on the most comfortable setting, especially if you sit in the backseat. Everytime we go out as a family, the kids would run to my wife's car. I am really disappointed at the infotainement system. Search and scrolling through the setting is so antique, I wish they can learn from Tesla or Volve how to make the infotainment system user friendly: easy to use and attractive.  I don't think I will be keeping the car beyond its waranty, God knows what else Audi was misleading the customers in their products.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Love It, Totally!",
  "audi_a6_2016": " This is my third A6. I loved my other two and actually went to a new dealership for the third and had a wonderfully helpful sales person. The third one is the best looking of my three and I was so ready to love it. I hate it. Literally, the worst car I have had since my first BMW 7 series. I bought the prestige model with all the technology packages including the heads up display and driver assist. Truly, almost nothing works right. I can't input addresses into the GPS, the brake assist never works, it rattles like the frame is not welded onto the frame, the phone system and voice activation never gets names rights and I constantly loose calls that I am able to keep when driving the same route in my wife's Mercedes. I have been on the phone with 'Audi Experience' no less than 20 times. I have been through endless fights with service where I can demonstrate what is not working, take screen shots and they admit they cannot fix it. The regional service rep was going to call his software guy in Germany except the guy was on vacation. I think I will need to look into 'lemon law' protection as this is intolerable. Going back to Mercedes or BMW. They are totally clueless. I went from being a loyal Audi fan to hating every day in the car. Buyer beware!",
  "audi_a6_2016": " This A6 is one of the smoothest rides I have had.  Great acceleration and command of the road.  A joy to drive.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Coming from 5-series BMW I see a few faults in this car: horrible gas mileage for a 2 liter engine! I'm getting about 12 mpg in traffic with rather conservative driving habits. Navigation system is OK, but certainly missing street routing and traffic display for local streets that I'm acostoumed to relay on for my daily commute. Engine vibration, while not a deal breaker, can be pretty annoying in stop and go traffic. Controls are less than intuitive (may be personal preference).",
  "audi_a6_2016": " So far really enjoying the A6.  It's the right size, looks terrific, a comfortable cruiser and the materials inside and out are top notch.  It's really too early to comment about things like reliability, maintenance costs etc., but both my wife (the primary driver) and I feel good about the purchase.  The A6 replaces a Q5 which was our first Audi and the ownership experience was stellar.After 6 months we're still enjoying the A6.  No issues at all.  A very solid car.  The ride might be a little firm for some, as ours has the sports suspension, but I enjoy the sharp steering and handling that comes with it.  One niggle is the placement of the HVAC controls.  They sit very low on the center stack and are difficult to see and adjust while driving.  Something used so frequently should be in a better location.  One option is to set the system to AUTO and forget about it - But at times things need to be tweaked.  Overall, a great car and deserving of the praise that's it's received.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " A great driving car.  Handles well, great pick-up.  For those of you who are technologically challenged, there is a lot to learn about many of the features of the car.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Nice car",
  "audi_a6_2016": " First thing my wife said as we were driving in a rain storm, WOW this car handles the bad weather great. It just does everything well and with ease, you will notice how well everything in the Audi's function when you get into another car. I am surprised at the gas mileage, 32 on a 25 mile commute to work every day on a mix of highway and 2 lane hilly roads. Acceleration is great, friends shocked when I floor it. My second Audi, will be more....",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Hands down this is the finest vehicle I've ever purchased. An absolute joy to drive in town or road trips.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " This is my second A6 and I will probably buy another. This is a great road car, very comfortable on long trips. The interior and electronics are top notch. Buy the audi care for the first four services. It will save you you a lot of money. Audi makes a great car that is fun to drive.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Best car I've ever had.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " This car handles like a sports car on the back roads. You would never know it is a mid sized car. I have a BMW Z and it is second fiddle to this car. Acceleration is quick and gas mileage is in low thirties driving 70 mph. What's not to like. Plenty of leg room in both front and back with a pretty good size trunk. The led headlamps are amazing. I have two other cars with HID, but no comparison. The car is just fun to drive and the driver assistance with lane tracking works great. It does tell you to put your hands on the steering wheel after about 15 seconds, but I just like checking it out. Before I purchased, I tried the E300 and the 535xi. The E300 was old fashioned, the acceleration was subpar and it did not feel as sharp in the handling. My wife was leaning towards the BMW 535XI until we drove the 3.0 A6. Then we drove them again and it was no contest. The BMW handling was nowhere as good as this A6. Loving it.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " I've been in the automotive manufacturing sector ( worked for a major transplant automotive manufacturer in the 80's and owned a supply company for 27 years ) so I've always had a love affair for great automobiles. I've admired the Audi's for a few years, so once I retired and not now tied to a major customer auto brand, I traded my Lexus LS for the A6. I was impressed with the style, handling, driving dynamics, quality of manufacturing, interior materials, fit and finish, fuel economy, and layout. After 10,000 miles, I'm still as pleased as with day 1. This car is a pleasure to drive, has a conservative style, lots of power from the 3.0, quiet and fun to drive. You must get used to watching your speed. You can find yourself approaching triple digits on the highway without realizing it. At first, I hated the pop-up info display, but have warmed up to it nicely. Once your all set with climate control, music, etc., you can allow it to disappear, and the looks of the dash is so streamlined compared to the huge screens on most other luxury vehicles. Good sized rear seating, and trunk for a car of this size. Really like the Google Maps on the huge screen. Really slick to,see Google Earth exactly where you are driving, the buildings, landmarks, and interesting things just beyond your street view as you drive down a highway. The wifi is a nice addition for the passenger to enjoy as well. The choices found in the on screen system for adjusting the lighting, door locking, driving dynamics, Climate Control, entertainment, etc. is great. My wife liked my A6 so much, she got the A8L.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " If you are looking for a sports sedan, than this is it.  I have test driven all the German sedans (mid size)  and the CTs, and this is by far the best.  Fit and finish is exemplary. Ride is excellent and the transmission some how knows what you are thinking. I can go on and on, but really, if you are looking to purchase or lease one, you will not be sorry.",
  "audi_a6_2016": " Still loving it after all these months....18 to be exact, and still this A6 is a dream to drive, own and remains trouble free.  Even after the first year and half, the car has all of the  exuberance of new car ownership.  All that has changed is that I ",

  "audi_a6_2017": " I have only had this car for a month but am still in love with it.  The interior cabin is loaded and rides extremely smooth.  The initial acceleration is a little sputtery but I believe it is due the emission auto off feature that comes standard.  MMI system is easy and simple to use and I love the heads up display options and how easily you can change them.",
  "audi_a6_2017": " Great car but avoid the 20 inch summer tires if you want a comfort ride. The 20 inch handle much better when the car is pushed in the curves. But for everyday, the smaller tires are better overall. This is my third Audi and I am sold.",
  "audi_a6_2017": " rear view camera (360) is soft low pixels with no adjustments. Stretched to fit a wider screen without the needed DPI. Cant make out a rear wall in low light.  Very disappointed for a luxury auto to chintz on such a important safety feature.",
  "audi_a6_2017": " I considered and drove the usual suspects in this class. While the A6 rise to my top spot among the German imports, I found the design and features to be a bit dated. Probably about two years behind the Swedish and other imports.",

  "audi_a7_2016": " I traded a 2013 Lexus ES350 for the A7.  The Lexus was the best car I've ever owned, comfort-wise, overall performance, etc..  But the ES is a smooth sedan, without much punch.  The Audi, in comparison, is that redhead in high school you wished you'd asked to the prom, just to see what might happen after the prom!  It is fun, and that sums it up.  It's over priced for the money one can choose from an array of fine rides, BMW, Mercedes, maybe a Jag, any of which could get your blood flowing.  But this a vehicle you won't see too many of on the street.  It truly stands out with great styling.  I've had no less than four strangers tell me what a fine looking auto the A7 is.Audi is famous for beautiful interiors and this car has one.  The interfaces, voice or touch, are superior to the Lexus, in my opinion, very nice for a non-techie such as myself.  The media interface alone is marvelous.At first I wasn't sure about the feature where the engine shuts off at red lights (on or off, your choice), but have come to appreciate the option, especially since premium fuel is strongly recommended, the main negative thus far.  The restart is nearly seamless and I expect we'll see this in many more cars in the future.Overall, this is the most fun, best driving vehicle I have ever owned.",
  "audi_a7_2016": " This is my second A7, and the improvements in performance, reliability, style, and technology are significant. I chose this car above all German and Japanese equivalents, and it was no contest. Ease off the line and it rolls sedately forward. Crush the pedal and it pins you back in the seat, the engine giving a subtle growl that quickly becomes a roar. 70mph comes fast, as the steering, handling, and balance tighten. It is the best performing sedan I've ever driven. Hit the gas out of the apex and it hunkers down and rockets out of the turn. The curve speed sign says 40mph? Try 70 and you will be fine. The interior is sumptuous, ergonomic, and classy without being fussy. The electronic systems are user-friendly but have layers and layers of functionality once you start exploring. In the snow, this car outperforms the most eager SUV. Speaking of SUVs, when you open the lift gate you have a storage cave that serves almost any cargo need. Every possible situation was contemplated with this car. This A7 feels like an extension of me--more so the longer I own it. And as with my 2012, the 2016 turns heads and solicits conversation wherever I go. I have the Mythos black with Nougat interior, and it couldn't be more compelling. The car exudes understated success and standing, and imbues the same upon its driver. My only fear is that one day Audi will stop making the A7. It's that good.",
  "audi_a8_2016": " If you want a 4-door sedan that drives, handles and accelerates fantastically you need to buy an Audi A8L.  I have had numerous Mercedes, BMW and Porsche vehicles and this car tops them all.  It is a stealth vehicle that doesn't stand out with chrome, radical styling, 'look at me, I'm expensive' statements.  It just quietly goes about its job of getting you where you want to go in comfort with all the power you can handle at your right foot.  I have had it only 1000 miles that did include a 500 mile trip.  Great seat comfort, quiet interior, all  you could want for a long drive in heavy Southern California traffic.  I am totally satisfied!I now have 14,780 miles on the car.  No problems and amazingly not one rattle in the car.  I am still totally satisfied.",
  "audi_q3_2016": " I purchased my 2016 Prestige Q3  quattro with the Sport Package in Nov 2015 and love this SUV. I surprised myself when I bought this since I wasn't looking for a xe2x80x9cluxuryxe2x80x9d SUV. However, I had shopped for over a year and drove virtually every other SUV in its' class and was just not impressed with the drive and handling (or sound systems) of the Q3's competitors. I love how this SUV handles on winding roads and love driving it so much I look for excuses to take it out! I've read several reviews suggesting the Q3 may have below average acceleration and power but have not found this to be the case at all, even with passengers in the car. To me it's like driving a sports car with an awesome sound system. Some blogs suggest you can purchase a Sprint Booster module for even faster acceleration but I don't feel I need it. There is no lag in acceleration when I hit the gas unlike other SUVs in its' class that I have test driven. I've only needed to take in for service for the first oil change/checkup its' basically been flawless since I bought it over a year ago.",

For a 4-cylinder, performs well, with good acceleration and an extremely smooth ride.  The handling is amazing - like a sports car.  With the leather interior the cars smells so good!  :-)  The trunk is small-ish, so if you have kids maybe this is not the car for you - consider the Q5.  But it holds a LOT with the rear seats down if you have to haul something.  Minor quirk - I would have liked the adjustable steering column to have more adjustment down, as it sits a little high for me, even as a 6 foot driver.    Mileage:   On the highway, the indicator shows about 32 MPG - not bad.  But actual measurement is about 29 on the highway - surely a modern 4-cylinder can do better!",

My biggest criticism is the height of the media/nav window that you cannot get rid of- cannot fold down or black out.

  "audi_q3_2016": " This 2016, Audi Q-3, Prestige Quattro, is a nice design. PROS: The colors are great both Inside (chestnut brown leather) and Out (cuvxc3xa9e silver metallic). The car holds the road firmly and has a good ride. The steering is crisp and the breaking is excellent.  Headlights are awesome when driving at night on unlit roadways.  Seats are fairly comfortable with the Sport Package that was included as an option.  However, not nearly as comfortable as the seats in an A-4.  Sight lines out of the car are great.CONS: the electronics (Nav, phone, Wi-Fi) are a little difficult to get used to, but can be handled with some practice. Heated seats take forever to warm up.  Rear view camera takes too long to turn off after shifting back to a forward gear.  The only engine available for this car, 2.0 L / 4 cylinder / TFSI, that produces 200 hp , 207 ft-lb torque, is minimally enough for the car. And that's with just me as the driver.  If I had 3 other adult passengers in the car with me, the engine would struggle even more to get the car moving.

So when I went back to pick up my wife's car, I decided to sit down with a salesperson to discuss the possibility of trading in my A3. The deals they were offering were excellent, and I just wasn't willing to wait to see how Audi was going to resolve the emission issue affecting the 2.0 TDI engines.So far, I'm extremely happy with my decision. The Q3 with Prestige and Sport Packages is a real step up from my 2011 A3 TDI. The ride is extremely comfortable and the cabin is incredibly quiet.

Love the auto climate control and the cargo area is big enough for my bike which is why I wanted a crossover. It's fabulous and zippy on steep, curvy mountain roads. I'm averaging 24.5 mpg with combo city/highway (mostly city) driving. My only challenge is figuring out all the computer programs in the car and setting everything up to my preferences. The car manual has become my lifeline and I have to reference it often as it's a bit complex. The cruise control/radio/navigation/windshield wiper/etc. controls are pretty easy to access from the steering column but I find that I hit the wrong controls occasionally because everything is in one place. Huge learning curve with the car ( but then, my old car was a 2004 so I'm behind the times for car technology) but I have to say I'm very, very happy with it.",

My mother-in-law really likes the Q-3 because it is just the right height for  getting into and out of - the A-6 was too low and my wife's Land Rover Disco was too high.",

I love the leather, the style and the look of the car. The instrument panel is really nice. It's easy to understand and easy to operate. What I was really surprised about is the power and the handling of the car. It has more power than I am use too.

Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It's appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I'm proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.",

When the car was 2 days old the backup warning system failed and I backed into a mailbox   The dealer told me the system sensors needed a deep cleaning, which they did, but would not repair a small dent.  I complained to Audi, they said it is up to the dealer because that would be covered under the warranty.  The dealer said Audi refuses to pay for the damage.  During the next six months the GPS would freeze and the MMS system would simply not turn on at times.  I complained to the dealer again this times they told me there was an update to the software due to problems that Audi was having.  The dealer and Audi Still refused to take responsibility for a failed system.  This will be my last Audi not because the Q5 isn't a good car but because Audi does not back their vehicles like other companies I have dealt with in the past.",
  "audi_q5_2016": " I had a 2014 Q5 Premium Plus 2.0 lease that was up for renewal recently.   In over 30 years of leasing vehicles I've NEVER leased the same vehicle twice as every one of them seemed to have some quirk or flaw that made me want to try something different.   However, in this case I ended up leasing the a newer version of the exact same Q5.  Why? because I test drove everything else out there and could not bear to part with the Q5.   Superb all around car and hands down the best engines on the road today.   After 36K miles on the 2014, zero flaws and the exterior and interior still look it came off the showroom.   My new 2016 is even better, if that's possible. There is a reason this SUV consistently gets 5 star ratings.",

At some point, between the 2008 and 2011 models, BMW turned into Lexus.  The 2011 535i was a thoroughly competent vehicle.  It had an excellent engine.  Everything else was just vanilla.  It simply was not the type of car you looked forward to driving.  I bought a 2016 Q5 3.0T.  Its great to drive a true German car again.  The steering in this car allows you to feel the road.  The suspension is firm and engaged but doesn't come close to feeling harsh.  There are plenty of luxury features.  in short, if you enjoy driving a car but like the convenience of an SUV, this is simply a great car.",

The 3.0 liter is very quick and really goes when you need it. It is quiet with windows up and the sun roof is huge with no vibration with Windows up. A first for me. Voice command could be better and that's my only complaint. Quiet ride which is stiff and secure which I prefer. Decided to buy before model change because I knew what I was getting and really like this model.",

The parking assist is really helpful.A few minor hiccups are, there are no USB ports. Has one connector in the glove box to hook up an iPod classic or older generations. Can add the new iOS connector as an attachment but cannot have the phone connected to it and Bluetooth on at the same time.Got only the Audi care package included and declined the packages for paint n dent protection. Got a ski rack included with the vehicle, it's lying indoors and will stay dead till the year I ski. A prospective buyer should probably negotiate for a cargo carrier if not interested in the ski rack.The drive and music are good, will know about the maintanence costs only after a few years.",
  "audi_q5_2016": " My 2016 Q5 is an excellent overall car, looks great, interior finish is very good, and 2.0 Turbo runs very well with good acceleration.  Gas mileage is ok for 4 cylinder turbo and large gas tank gives you great driving range.  Gas mileage should be much higher on highway.  I get mid 20's at best overall. Radio sound is excellent and easy media interface but no USB port.  The Navigation system works well and it's great to be able to send your directions to the car from Google or my cell. Overall the Nav is easy and accurate to set.  Voice controls works as well as any of them but could use work.  The push button start works well and the best feature is the side mirror closure when the locks and alarm are set.  Works great and all automatic on closure and on open.  The Audi grille and overall look is special and there's plenty of room in the rear compartment.  I also like that you can roll the rear seats forward for more cargo room, very nice.   Just a great car to drive and a great look and overall good functionality for a mid size SUV.  Get great feedback from all on the looks of the Q5.",

  "audi_q5_2016": " We bought the 2016 3.0 TDI prestige package with all options and initial we are very happy with the choice we made.  Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV's.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.  In my opinion ",
  "audi_q5_2016": " The Q5 is well made, fast, comfortable and quiet.  The most impressive thing for me was the power of the 4 cylinder turbo.  I was really aiming for the 6 cylinder. But, it was unnecessary as the 4 is fast, powerful and it shifts beautifully.  The moon roof and features are impressive.  Gas mileage has been very good.  Overall, very happy with this decision.",
  "audi_q5_2016": " We flip a coin to see who gets to drive our 2016 Audi Q5 on road trips. Can't say enoughabout all the positive aspects of this vehicle. Handling, comfort, interior, are all impressive.The sunroof is a great plus to this SUV as well, which filters to just let enough light in no matter what season.",
  "audi_q5_2016": " I've become a big fan of diesels for their driving characteristics and efficiency.  The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I'm enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I'm pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase.",
  "audi_q5_2017": " I do enjoy driving this SUV it's comfortable, good looking, and performs well. Instrumentation is overly complicated and requires some study if a driver is older. In the first week of owning it, the car developed a major engine problem that originated on the manufacturer's assembly line. The repair was major, and I was advised by independent engineers that there is no assurance that this car could not have another major problem in the future. The dealer was sympathetic and offered me an Audi Care package and 12,000 new car warranty miles.  They think this should cover my inconvenience, but I have no assurance that this Audi will hold up for the long haul.  I don't think I got what I paid for.",
  "audi_q5_2017": " Shopped around quite a bit for a mid-level luxury car and the Q5 ultimately met all my desires.

Please note that I have only owned this car for one month so I cannot rate its reliability or maintenance costs (I left it on the default rating of OK or NA).     However, with regard to everything else it is a perfect fit for me.   I wanted a smaller SUV that was not a gas guzzler but was capable of towing my horse trailer but was also a little sporty.  I have not towed with it because it was a CPO and no tow package included.  Manual says it can tow up to 4500 lbs and the reviews say the car tows easily.  (My aluminum 2-horse trailer weighs 2000 lbs and my horse weighs about 1200 which means I can tow with 2 horses in the trailer which is perfect!)",
  "audi_q5_2017": " The interior of the Q5 is much nicer than the BMW X3. Test drove both the 2.0 and the 3.0 six cylinder and unless you need the extra hp, (towing or mountain roads)  the 2.0 four cylinder is plenty. Didn't really want the full sunroof but it shouldn't be an issue in cooler climates.",

  "audi_q7_2017": " This is the first time we purchased an Audi - we were sold by the excellent interior and a new, understated style that comes with the 2017 model. Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We've since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+ some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off) the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won't hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the ",

  "audi_q7_2017": " This is really an adult car and not a kid carrier.  I went for the adaptive chassis which gives the Q7 amazing road holding. This car is loaded with technology.  Audi should hold classes the way Apple does to familiarize the owner with everything this car is capable of doing. You have the ability to control all the cameras that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360 degree views at will.  The driver's seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It's a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car's technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package.",
  "audi_q7_2017": " This is a very high quality vehicle.  Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350 making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don't mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20",
  "audi_q7_2017": " Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn't in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21",
  "audi_q7_2017": " We enjoyed the test drive and were thinking serious about this SUV. Good looking and good finishes made this attractive in comparison to the X5 and GLE 350. Drove great.  We found the technology a little cumbersome but that could be expected as it was new to us but not as difficult as other test drives. The navigation voice commands could not recognize very much. The salesman indicated that it would get used to our voices. Right.  I checked this out with a current owner. He confirmed that voice commands are limited to his contact list.  The kicker for me was there was no spare tire! The salesman went looking for it and could not find it! It was sorta funny but it wasn't.  Their defense was it was equipped was run-flat tires with a 50 mile range. That may work for city slickers but we go to remote locations and that won't hunt. The  X5 also has no spare.  I understand that this is becoming more common but its not for me.",

So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions as usual, the ",
  "audi_q7_2017": " Recently made a switch from '13 BMW X5 50i to a '17 Q7 Prem Plus. Great car with lots of updates in tech and safety. Comfortable and quiet. While the engine has the punch in 'dynamic' mode, it lacks in 'auto' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn't great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls. I have not been able to hit the manufacturer's gas mileage of 19 city/25 highway/21 combined. So far locally I am getting 15 mpg or less and 20 mpg on highways. This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I've been more critical than happy so far... I am just starting to get comfortable with the changes and hopefully it will get better over time. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle. Let's hope it is reliable and will last and retain good re-sale value.",

As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.",

Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW's comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It's quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn't. Also, because Audi doesn't make enough of the Q7's, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit.

Head up display, as Paul already mentioned, produces ugly glares on a windscreen, right in front of you, distracting and destroying the whole experience of having a head up display technology. The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn't help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector. Driver assistance package seems like an interesting enhancement but the car doesn't fully stop itself as advertised. You better read about all the limitations etc. The last one and a very annoying issue it the air-conditioning. The level of the noise the funs produce on a sunny days is hard to bear.  If I had the money in my pocket again I would seriously consider other vehicles like GLS or XC90. Perhaps this is what I'm going to do. Wait for the new GLS and trade it in. Good luck.",
  "audi_q7_2017": " I love my Q7, but I'm having problems already and have only owned it since the end of June. The hatch has a tendency to not to want to open and it makes a screeching noise when it does open. You have to try and pull it up enough to shut it so you can try and open it again. I've had it in for a fix and all they did was a master reset. What good is that really going to do?? Ha, nothing, as it is happening again. I'm pretty sure the pre sense is not working. I've had a couple close calls where it should have and it didn't work.  But they tell me it is. I've just started having issues with the key remembering my settings. I have had to push the button several times now to get it where I have it set for me.  I'm wondering if I made a mistake buying this Audi. :( I got rid of my explorer because I was constantly bringing it in for the same problems they couldn't seem to get fixed right. I don't want to have to be doing that again!",
  "audi_q7_2017": " Head up display optics produce glares which at times can be very distracting. They can be small i.e. two bright points or it can appear as two bright lines, or (pretty bad) large and very bright, and rather large (size of a credit card) spot. If you live in California or any other place with plenty of sun, test drive the car in the middle of the day and make sure you can live with this issue. This alone can be a road block. Side mirrors produce a high pitch noise. Turn off the radio while test driving and listen carefully to the mirrors. In windy days it can be very obvious and annoying. Driver assistance system is far worse than the one you can find on a brand new Volvo XC 90. It is confirmed by IIHS. Test drive both cars and you will see what I mean. Major concerns on quality of the materials used. This may not be a perfect option for demanding person paying attention to details.",
  "audi_q7_2017": " I just bought the 2017 Q7.  It's disturbing that the skimped on some of the features found on lesser vehicles.  Here's my bucket list of the features that this car should have came with:  1.  Remote start from key fob.  2.  Convex overhead mirror (to watch the kiddos in the back)  3.  Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.  Driver's key pad for vehicle entry (Ford may be the only company doing this).  5.  Sunglass holder (pretty simple option).   6.  Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I'm happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.  Run flats are a huge disadvantage all around.  I haven't got into the maintenance phase yet, but I'll update my post at that time.",

  "audi_q7_2017": " My wife and I have owned primarily BMW products for the last 25 years until my wife leased a VW Tiguan three years ago.  I drove it from time to time and was impressed so when it was time to replace a 2012 X5 I looked at the redesigned Q7.  The ride, handling, and performance is as good or better than the X5 and the fit and finish is far superior.  It has a little more room inside while not seeming to be larger on the outside.  The ride is a little less harsh and more quiet than the X5.  Handling install responsive and the turning radius is excellent.  It is a joy to drive.  It is also easier to fit multiple sets of golf clubs horizontally in the cargo area.  I have had the car for about a month and so far no problems.  Everything works well.  The 2017 redesign is a great improvement over the previous model.  Can't say enough good things about this vehicle.",

Rather than going into the pros and cons of every one, I will just say we chose the Q7 because of its tremendous balance between ride and handling, its superior quietness and solid feeling, and combined comfort of the first and second rows.  We also suspect that the Audi will be more reliable than the Volvo XC90 (although the Volvo is somewhat less expensive, has superior interior design and has a more comfortable first and third row).   While the Q7 cost more money than we needed to spend, I believe it is worth every dollar.  So do many others.  In my area, every Q7 was spoken for.  I purchased mine from a dealer 200 miles away,",

  "audi_q7_2017": " I replaced a 2011 Q7 S-Line with 100,000 miles with the new 2017.  I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user face to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang , Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG and I have hit 28+MPG on a few tanks of highway driving.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range has improved on the 2017 by 50-70 miles despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  Also, the ability to utilize the map on the driver's dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry actually works, the old system had so many time delays built into it for some unknown ",
  "audi_q7_2017": " We spent month looking at, researching, and reading about the 2017 Q7.   This car has exceeded our expectations in all categories.  Beautiful to look at, easy to drive, and comfortable for all passengers.  The Q7 is roomy enough for trips to the big box store, while feeling like a comfy sports car.  My Porsche driving husband is impressed by the handling at highway speeds and in parking lots.  The rear seats provided more than ample leg room for two 6'+ passengers.  I love all the creature comforts and goodies: get the Premium Plus!",
  "audi_q7_2017": " I was considering it, and it was my top choice until I found out they only come with Run Flats.

Sorry Audi, I LOVE My A5 Cabrio, but will now buy someone else's car just because of the Run Flats.",
  "audi_q7_2017": " a very nice car, perhaps a little overwhelming in the technology it offers. Drives well, smooth low speed manners, very nice handling (within the limits of a short test drive). Feels like a hell of a lot of vehicle, though I would be somewhat concerned about maintenance costs when out of warranty - there's a hell of a lot of mechanical and electrical equipment in the car.",
  "audi_q7_2017": " I spent a ton of time researching and comparing the Q7 with the 2016 BMW X5 and the Volvo XC90. I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car , Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner's manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn't up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can't even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile. I love this SUV!",

There's no other option then run flat tires!? which ONLY available with one of THE WORSE in the market GoodYear tires, so you'll be luck to get 18K miles on it! Road noise and handling, again - crappy GoodYear tires,  no improvement on gas mileage, DO NOT be fool of that streaker 19/25 mpg, you're still getting about 16/22 mpg, and about 19 mpg in the suburbs, again it could be the GoodYear's run-flat's which are terrible, a specialty in the ice or snow conditions, do your self a favor and stay home.",

Just to correct one thing, it does have a USB port in the console under the armrest right next to the Audi connect port. For perspective, I've owned several BMW's including 3 and 5 series, a Z4 3.0 and a slew of Benzes ranging from S-Class and G-Wagen to SLK and CLK430 and currently a mint CLS500. Two cars before this purchase, I owned a Porsche Cayman S for 4 years.  I've autocrossed, done track days and been a sports car fan since the late 50's when I first saw Jim Kimberly in his Ferrari win a race.  Enough history.  I shopped the M235i and MB GLA45 AMG before making this buy. The S3 is a true entry level luxury rocket. It has all the tech anyone could want (and probably never use). Mine is a Prestige and has all the Driver's assistance goodies, e.g. adaptive cruise, lane assist, blind spot monitoring, Presense braking, etc. These things are truly workable and disconnectable, great for interstate cruising. Now there is also Launch Control, along with 4 driving modes.  The sound when in Dynamic, or S drive is among the best I've heard.  And did I mention this thing really does fly. Audi says 0-60 in 4.7 sec. Motor Trend, C,D say 4.4 sec. One does have to know how to make it launch but it can be done in several ways only has one ",

Handling and agility are tight and inspire confidence.  Acceleration is great, especially for the size of the engine after taking it out for a spin, it took some effort to convince my friends and family that it was only a four-cylinder engine.  Shifting into higher gear at high revs sounds great, but engine noise when daily driving is calm and unobtrusive.The size is great for an urban area when you still want to fit people in the backseat - I'm 5'11",

I am coming from driving a 2012 E93 BMW M3 convertible, which was an excellent car in its own right. I expected to like the S3 after test driving it, but I could never imagine that I will like driving it more than the M3. Where the M3 felt powerful and fast the S3 feels quick and nimble. It is difficult to explain, but for me, driving the S3 is more relaxing and more controlled at the same time. M3 had better steering and better breaks even though S3's steering and breaks are excellent too. I like the power delivery of the S3 better. In S mode there is no turbo/transmission lag and D mode is OK for everyday driving. Magnetic/Active damping makes the car more comfortable, it is stiff, but not nearly as harsh as the M3 was.One thing I haven't figured out and having a slight trouble with is the Bluetooth connection. I am using it with Nexus 6P and streaming music gets muted very shortly after the car starts and Bluetooth gets connected. The music is still streamed but sound is not coming through the car or the phone. I need to turn off Bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to fix it. After that all is well. Also, if I use Waze and Audible through Bluetooth, Waze interrupts the audiobook, but there is no sound coming from Waze, so I know that it was trying to tell me something, but not what it was trying to say.",

Acceleration is less in SQ5 than the Bimmer, but everything else is extremely comparable.   Handling tightly the curvy NC mountain roads, crushing light to light performance on the straight roads of Florida, limo like feel for the date nights with my wife, and of course Quattro safety.   Cannot say enough great things.   My wife is a hard sell on my sports car addiction, but this car  is now her daily driver passing by our corvettes, BMW M4, and others including a Hummer that she calls ",
  "audi_sq5_2016": " I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn't get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best xe2x80x9cpracticalxe2x80x9d choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good xe2x80x93 Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can't say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5xe2x80x9d screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own. I look for reasons to run out for something just to drive it!Lastly, golf clubs will fit fore to aft if you slide the rear seats forward a couple inches.",

  "audi_tt_2016": " OK, so I am a TT fanatic.  I've owned or leased 2 first generation, 3 second generation and now my third generation TT.  This is the best yet in all respects:  design, performance, miles-per-gallon, technology and fun.  Even one of my relatives who is not a car person marveled at the car and was especially impressed with the safety features, including the blind spot warning feature.  It's beautiful on the outside with just enough edge to keep it fresh but still maintains the overall sophistication and timeless design of the original.  It hugs the road like no other, and I find myself accelerating into curves.  The seats are exceptionally comfortable and adjustable.  I'm not a race care driver, but I've certainly had no trouble getting this car up to 70-80 MPH in no time at all.  I still love the automatic spoiler.  But it's the technology that's the true star.  The virtual cockpit is amazing.  While it took my maybe half a day to get used to it (definitely worth reading the owner's manual), once I did, it became intuitive.  You barely have to take your eyes off the road (just a simple glance down) and never have to take your hands off the wheel to manage any and all functions.  While not necessary, I have opted for Audi Connect and find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I especially like that I can have the system read my texts and emails to me out loud.  I feel obligated to find something to criticize the only thing I would request is to be able to adjust the lumbar support up and down more -- a wider range of vertical motion.  Other than that, the car is perfect in my eyes.",
  "audi_tt_2016": " This car is a technological show case!  It is quick, responsive, comfortable and solid.  Mine is the base model and still awesome.  I will find out about the quattro all wheel drive this winter.  With its' weight distribution it should be great.  The body being aluminum is great for corrosion resistance and light weight strength.This car allows you to adjust drive settings to your liking.  It is better than I anticipated.",
  "audi_tt_2016": " Nice upgrade from a new 2016 Mazda Miata but miss the manual gearbox. Dynamic and Sport mode are good but Auto and Comfort frustrating to drive. Engine is near silent although dynamic mode pipes a false exhaust sound through the radio speakers - blah! I just had a performance exhaust installed by Remus and you can hear the engine now but still not loud. MPG ranges from 13 to 17 mpg according to the dash readout. Maybe in comfort mode it would be better but that's like driving a Corolla. Fit and finish very good, looks great and tons of new tech. Much cheaper than a boxster.  Excellent German engineering all round but lacking that excitement factor. Nothing else really compares at this price point.",
  "audi_tt_2016": " Overall a really great car. I have driven the car about 1200 miles now over the last month. The only complaint I have is in normal drive (not sport mode), the car shifts too quickly causing lower rpm and sluggish performance at the low rpm, the engine almost starts knocking. Once you punch the accelerator, it downshifts quickly and performance is great. In sport mode, the car drives perfectly, shifting smoothly with incredible acceleration. In dynamic drive, the car handles like a race car, hugging corners with no body roll. Paddle shifts are easy to use, just need to get used to them since I am use to a normal manual transmission. Don't put anyone in the back seats, it is good for holding bags.",
  "audi_tts_2016": " This is Audi's version of a Porsche!  Probably the Cayman S is the closest competitor in my view in terms of performance.  The Audi brings a fantastic quattro AWD system and rear seats for people under 5' tall (and I do mean UNDER 5' tall).  Audi has been making uber-reliable cars lately, and this one is no exception.  In fact, the only problem I've had is with the dorky blind spot monitor sensors.   I recommend sticking with the OEM 19",
  "audi_tts_2016": " be ready to pay close to sticker or sticker however every dime is worth an exhilarating drive and ride. Very fast and responsive in Sport mode!",
  "audi_tts_2016": " Disclaimer, I purchased a TTS but this information is still pertinent to a TT buyer(Dynamics) With the recent refresh, Audi brings the TT more inline with its yet to be released R8 big brother. The new IE8888 2.0 liter turbo four cylinder works beautifully with the S-tronic transmission (the only one available in the U.S.). There is just a bit of turbo lag below 2500 rpm, but once in the boost power is of no concern at all. The acceleration is more than enough for the average driver, and at freeway speeds even the base TT passes other cars with ease (but be sure to let the S-tronic downshift a couple gears first). With Audi's Quattro system, grip in poor conditions is not a problem if you're being reasonable (note: I live in a very snowy area of the U.S.) but I have gotten it to intentionally slide at low speeds. In dry conditions you'd have to be quite reckless to get this thing to lose grip, but it is manageable when the rear steps out of line. It handles well, but, (and this is a critique of all Audis I've experienced) the steering is pretty numb and doesn't provide much in the way of feedback on the road surface. The steering is, however, well weighted and is direct enough that I barely even need to think about where I want the car to go. The suspension is on the firmer side but it isn't harsh or jarring at all on decent road surfaces, body roll through corners is negligible and the chassis feels rock solid. Fuel economy is also better than advertised in my car, at freeway speeds I have achieved 29 mpg (US cycle) when I was told I should be getting 27.5 mpg or less(Technology) The Virtual Cockpit is undoubtedly the star of the Interior. It does take some time to get used to controlling almost  everything through the steering wheel, but once acclimated it is quite intuitive and easy to use, even on the move. Safety isn't too much of a concern since the system is mounted very close to eye level (also of note I'm only 5'8",
  "audi_tts_2017": " This coupe has been a pure joy to own, so far* (just sold an older Audi sports car, so well aware of the potential future service). She's nimble on windy roads with minimal body roll, and is quite sure-footed in snow, (Pirelli snow tires though one does need to avoid sudden jolts, with this many horses). The noted 0-60 speed has prob been underestimated. Acceleration is smooth throughout the power band, with only a hint of initial turbo lag. My only complaint, if there is one, is lack of standard transmission. The paddle shifters just aren't the same, but in reality the automatic mode (in Sport setting) shifts at all the proper points. Love that the dynamic mode shifts this car to rear-wheel bias with the touch of a button/also impacts cornering and these differences are noticeable to the driver. Plus, suspension changes can be immediately felt to dampen a rough road, if needed.",
  "audi_tts_2017": " Love everything about my 2017 TTS--except an o -ring on the pressurized oil line to the turbo charger was leaking from day 1. I got a warning at just over 200mi. Was promptly fixed, but my driveway is a mess with oil stains! Not wat to expect from a $60,000 vehicle.",
  "bmw_2-series_2016": " The car is a great toy for the mid life crisis male without kids to haul around anymore. Great performance without being too flashy, very practical for the day to day use, can be both a regular commute car and the car to have fun with. Hits the sweet spot for me of practicality, comfort and features, power, convenience and fuel economy. I have the manual RWD option, and the car is surprisingly well balanced and stable. All the electronic nannies manage to keep the car jumpy enough to give you good thrills without really putting you in dangerous situations. Want more fun, just disable most nannies and engage the sports driving mode with a couple of button pushes. Want a comfortable commute, just set it in eco pro mode, with a smooth suspension and more sedate engine configuration. The summer tires are an absolute blast to drive on and I got a set of studless winter tires for the cold weather, which worked remarkably well in snow and ice. I was a bit worried about a RWD car this powerful in the snow, but winter tires work wonders, handle better than an AWD with all seasons. Love this car, and got a really good deal purchased late in the year.",
  "bmw_2-series_2016": " Have driven BMWs exclusively since the early 1990s and this is my likely my last new one, BMW has really squandered a great deal of brand loyalty with this latest timid and tinny version of a once great car.

The Sport Display shows torque and HP used,  rarely reaching max around other cars so more would be a waste here in South Florida.  I also skipped the sport suspension this time and am much happier on the daily drive.

The car is capable an a hoot to drive with acceleration that will keep you scanning down the road a ways as it gobbles up the pavement.  My modified 2007 Scion tC is fun to drive, but this car is the definition of ultimate driving.

It's hard to read some of the negative reviews in which people had a completely different experience with their 2 series.  The M235i xDrive is not a cheap car.  Options add up quickly but leaves me with a big smile while driving.  When it's time to take it out look forward to the drive.   Was looking at getting the 2016 X1 but it did not put a smile on my face.  It was boring to drive and rode just OK.  Tried the M235i xDrive and loved it right away.  Bought one less than 1 week later.  2016 is the last year of BMW's 4year/50,000 mile COMPLETE warranty.  Everything is covered except tires.  No more so I opted not to wait for the M340i.  I believe it is as good as most reviewers say.  Consumer Reports gave it a score of 94.  Get it, enjoy it.",
  "bmw_2-series_2016": " The BMW M235. Automotive journalists seem to love this car. It ranks highly in every road test or comparison test. I think Consumer Reports rated it as the best new car you can buy. I've test driven it a few times and scratch my head. People say is faster than the old E92 M3 and maybe it is, but the joy of driving it is gone. It is a stellar performer. On my last test drive, triple digit speeds were no problem. It handled well, the brakes work well and the auto tranny is great to shift in manual mode. For me, the car did everything too well, but there was no sense of purpose or drama. I love to drive and want a visceral experience every time I'm behind the wheel. While the car is fast and comfortable (The inflatable seat bolsters are a nice touch), it lacks mojo. The engine is too smooth. I want to FEEL THE POWER, but haven't been able to. Honestly, I think the BMW 228 has better power delivery, it just needs more power/ torque. The problem with that car is the small power band. It feels great between 4000-6300 RPM, but feels flat everywhere else in the powerband. Meanwhile, it's better reviewed brother has more power, is faster, but feels less alive. I haven't driven the M2 yet so I can't compare. If BMW made a high-pressure, turbo four cylinder 2 series, that might be better.As for features- BMW makes one of the best built in nav systems there is. The H,K stereo is just OK. Its not super hi-fi in this BMW. I was able to fit 2 short adults in the backseat without them complaining.Overall, if you want to go fast and aren't a driving enthusiast I'd say to get the car. If you're a driving enthusiast like me, where speed is good but dynamics are key, I'd skip the car. I think the 228 is the better car and is cheaper then the M235. The slogan is The Ultimate Driving Machine, but ultimately, the M235i was a letdown. It was fast, smooth and comfortable, but it lacked the undefinable quality which is driving pleasure.",
  "bmw_2-series_2016": " 228i with track package.....Unless you enjoy being on a track, everyday driving with adaptive m suspension (THp) is frustrating. The adaptive suspension in comfort but mostly sport is jittery and jiggly on ever road that has a less than perfect Tarmac.Tire and road noise is disgusting. The car does not feel planted on the road except for highway driving. Steering is very capable and firmly hefty in sport( if you can bear the suspension)A great car except for the ride  most of the time!",
  "bmw_3-series-edrive_2016": " I leased a new 330e in mid-March and the fuel economy and performance are quite amazing. In almost 1,800 miles my fuel economy overall is 80 miles per gallon!  My commute is about 15 miles round trip and the car does it in fully electric MAXEDrive mode with the piston engine never coming on. I have 800 miles on the current tank and I've barely used half of the ten gallon tank. What has amazed me most is that I've driven about 65 percent highway miles and have still achieved this economy. It takes less than 2 hours to recharge on my level 2 charger and the electric range is about 15 miles on pure electric. The car replaced a BMW ActiveHybrid 3 and the 330e is far and away better in ride, handling and economy. For 2016 the sport package is standard which gives you sport seats as well as sport+ mode which firms up the steering and tightens up the shifting and throttle response. The transition from electric to piston engine is pretty seamless with a clunk occasionally occurring on the transition but most of the time almost unnoticeable. Last weekend I travelled 150 miles on the freeway and some twisty back roads and the overall fuel economy started at 84 mpg with it going down to 78 mpg by the end of the trip. I'm back up to almost 80 again today after a fully electric commute. Acceleration on electric is perfectly fine for urban driving and when you want performance it is as torquey as the 6 cylinder ActiveHybrid and faster than a 328i. With the $4000 tax credit it is priced the same as a 328i as well.  I am still experimenting with the 3 electric drive modes. MAXEDrive is fully electric for up to 15 miles. AUTOeDrive is a mixed hybrid and electric mode that switches from battery electric to gasoline or a combination depending on throttle input, speed and grade. SAVE mode is a hybrid mode that recharges a depleted battery and allows you to switch to fully electric mode at the end of a trip or to save battery for urban driving. The sport seats that are now standard are much better than the standard seats as well with better bolstering and an adjustable thigh support. Not everyone will get the economy I am getting as my commute is the ideal distance for the car's range and I plug in religiously, but the car is really exceeding even my high expectations.

I find the three series less smooth.four-cylinder engine is a bit underpowered. I hate stop start function. Just turn it off. German interiors can be spartan, options add up quickly. There are a few nitpick cons I have. I hated that you have to unlock the door from the center of the console. Fake leather seats not quite as comfortable as the real leather. I drive is a mixed bag. The back up camera screen  too small for a luxury car.Japanese car interiors are more intuitive. Controls are easier to read. If you don't get navigation then you can't speak to call... we have to use the rotary I drive dial. Get the parking sensors and the automatic door lock feature at a minimum.

The different drive modes are actually effective unlike some other brands. I love the idrive dial and technology and yet it keeps the classic BMW feel inside.

  "bmw_3-series_2016": " After several months of researching all types of different vehicles I ultimately decided on purchasing the 2016 340i xDrive. Overall, this vehicle met my needs and after reading countless reviews (consumer and professional) the 340i remained in my top three narrowed down selection. My personal needs for a vehicle required performance, luxury, AWD (due to the snowy winters in Chicago), and decent gas mileage (sub par mpg with my last vehicle, 2012 Dodge Charger SRT8). My 340i is equipped with the cold weather package ($800), driver assistance package ($950), M sport package ($2,600), technology package ($2,750), and the track handling package ($1,700). $8,800 for those added options is very steep in my opinion but after getting a good trade-in value along with very low APR financing, as well as a tax credit and 4 years free maintenance I felt that it all balanced out. As for my impression of the vehicle, let me start off with the interior. Although many people tend to favor the interiors of Cadillac, Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, etc...the BMW interior is still very nice and luxurious. I can understand if some people think it's beginning to appear a bit dated, but nonetheless it's still superior to many vehicles on the market. The Dakota leather sport seats are top notch quality and for the most part above average in terms of comfort. The anthracite headliner, aluminum and gloss black trim accents throughout the vehicle along with the ambient lighting (which is dimmable) all go together fairly nicely. The cabin is really quiet and there are no rattle like noises or unwanted vibrations. The exterior of the vehicle is the best looking to date for the 3 series sedan in my opinion. From the elegant lines on the hood and the minor refresh of the whole body in general gives the vehicle a great sporty look that is very tasteful but not overstated or too flashy.

The engine is smooth as silk and makes puts out some serious low end torque. For the price, this sedan is far worth it!",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " For 2016, BMW has really improved the 3 series, particularly the 328i model.  I was very impressed with the handling, and interior upgrades that make the car feel more expensive and more like a true BMW again.  The steering still has an artificial feel, but it is very precise and they have fixed the handling issues of the early models of this generation.  The car feels well composed and can take just about anything you throw at it.  Acceleration is terrific, and I found braking response to be just okay.  The Harmon Kardon stereo sounds great, and I wish it was standard as it is in the 340 - would definitely recommend it.  LED lighting package is well worth the money as it looks great with LEDs all around including turn signals front and rear.  Safety ratings are superb with five stars, and lots of available safety enhancing technology.  I hesitated for years to trade my 2011 3 series in for one of the new models, but I feel great about getting this 2016 328i x drive, as BMW has finally figured out what we wanted.  This car is fantastic.",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " Updated the review after driving for 1+ months.This car is awesome. Especially so since I upgraded from a Toyota Yaris. Handling and drive is awesome.I have owned, Camry, Civic, Toyota Yaris, Hyundai Veracruz in the past. Ever since I relocated to CA a couple of months back, I was suddenly faced with a 100 mile one way commute 5 days a week. And money became less of an issue since got a big jump in income. So I needed a car that was a. Fun to driveb. Comfortablec. Not too expensiveI always had a dream to own a BMW 3 series and now seemed like a good time to do that. I looked at what might look like a weird array of cars/SUVs - Chevy impala, Acura MDX and BMW 3 series. I liked the Chevy impala (2016 model) from a few rental experiences. And the Acura MDX seemed like a solid luxury SUV at a reasonable price (40k sale price on memorial day). But I went with a sedan (BMW 328) since likely no SUV can be as snappy as a 328.After now owning and driving 3k+ miles, I am very happy with my 328. It is a remarkably comfortable drive (although admittedly I use the eco mode more that I should). If I switch to Sport + mode, I can feel the immediate change in responsiveness. I think I will do that in the future. I get 30+ mpg combined since I have stayed on eco mode mostly. It might go down once I switch to Sport mode. Drive handling is awesome. Even when going at 80 mph, it is effortless and feels the same as driving 50 mph on a Yaris (although it is a bit of extreme comparison). And turning is very sharp. I had considered the 320 and the 340 also. The 320 seemed like a sensible choice, but the absence of fold down rear seat was a deal breaker. Also, the 180 hp on the 320 is not great when accelerating fast (does not have the BMW feeling). 340 was super nice. But I didn't want to shell out another $6k for an extra 80 hp (320 hp on the 340 vs 240 hp  on the 328)Couple of cons :a. The radio/iPhone song/channel searcher is to the right of the instrument panel. So I need to extend my arm when surfing channels or songs. It is tiring when I need to do it for a minute.b. If I choose eco mode, then the engine auto shut off is also selected automatically, which is a pain. I don't want my engine to shut off at road signal stops even if it saves me an extra 1mpg. I don't like the shudder when I press the accelerator to move.c. Was not able to easily pair the bmw garage door opener with my own home garage opener (This was tried by the dealer Encore service person). Now I need to figure out how to do it by going to some online message boards. Don't want to spend the extra time.",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " This is my family's fifth BMW.  I had a 2010 328i sedan and loved the performance.  I have also driven the 2016 328i as a service loaner and was very impressed.  When I first considered the 2016 320i it was with a lot of skepticism about the reduced horsepower compared to the 328.  I am so glad I took it for a test drive.  The acceleration is better than I expected, especially in Sport mode.  I have an X3 with the 2.0 L Turbo and I would say the 320 in Sport mode is about as fast as the X3.  Highway driving is great.  I was cruising at over 80 mph and it seemed effortless.  The handling and ride is excellent.  It is everything you would expect in a BMW. The steering is precise, it can turn and stop on a dime.  For those who are used to other luxury brands like Lexus or Mercedes, it may not be what you are used to.  BMW owners will feel right at home.  The car has fantastic leg room in the back seat (better than Audi A3 or A4 in my experience) and a huge trunk.  It is a great combination of practicality with sportiness.  Gas mileage is better than what I am getting on my X3.  My only complaint is that the seats seem a little flat, but they are good enough.  The Sport Package seats are better.  I saved around $5,000 versus the 328 and it is money well-saved.  The 328 is noticeably better in acceleration, but the 320 is a better value in my opinion.  Both are excellent cars.",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " Definitely it's the best bang for your buck as performance vehicle as of today market. I have test drove numerous of cars, RC F, RC350, C450AMG, GS 350, Q50S hybrid, Cayman S , GTS, then finally settle for 340i. Two years ago I owned a 335I and told myself I m not going back to BMW again after I returned it. Therefore I test drove so many cars but not BMW, but then when I looked at BMW again to see if they have any new, that's when I discovered 340i, so I took my wife to the dealership to test drive it, we felt in love with the car immediately.340i has so much torque from low rpm which my wife loves it compare to her IS350. 340i out performed IS350 easily, my wife is a big fan of Lexus but now she is driving the BMW daily now, I get to drive it on the weekend because we go everywhere together, you get the picture right, the car is mine but she gets to drive it, and i m stuck with the IS350 for the week.Anyway love the car and definitely would own it after 2-3 Gen come out",

BMW claims 0-60 between 4.6-4.8.I have my 340i loaded with all the options and its worth it. I test drove 320i and 328i but I went with 340i. It has 320hp with 330lb.ft torque and can keep up with many cars on the road. I really love driving it in Sport or Sport+ mode, plus exhaust is more deeper and fun. I will recommend 340i or 340ix and its one step below M3. Plus you save $15-20K.",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " I thought it might be useful for someone to get a more detailed review of this car based on personal experience of owning it and at the same time comparing it with other cars owed or tested. When somebody tells me 'I love my car, its great' it generally tells me very little. I heard that from the owners of KIA or Prius or Tahoe and other cars that I personally would try to avoid. They all have something good about them (if only the price) and are better than any car produced in India, for example, but that does not tell me exactly how these cars are  really better or worse than others. And that's the only thing that really matters, for me at least. So here it goes.I bought my new 340ix aboumonths ago and have about 1500miles on it now. Before that I owned for 3.5 years 335is coupe, before that Mercedes 320 Sport Edition and my wife owns (so me too to a degree) new Z4 35i and before that z4 35 sport and before that z3. Before getting into 340ix, while thinking of either re-leasing or replacing my 335is I tried BMW 435i, M325, 335i, M3, Mercedes c450amg, Audi4 and 5 and RS, Hyundai Genesis and that are all the cars (not to mention my experiences with rental Toyotas, VW, Chevrolet, Nissan and bunch of others) that I can compare. First, none of the tried cars were worth switching to from my 335is. With exception of M3. Which would go beyond what I was willing to pay. So finally arriving of the new 340ix did it. It matched engine power with 335is, it had x drive which I found attractive (335is was not fun driving around ski resorts), it had a couple of luxury items I'd like to have and it was a new car I could have for almost the same lease money. So what did I get? Considering I paid for M package, Track package, Park assist and ignored Navigation altogether. Actually, not one but four cars with very distinct personalities. Consequence of track and M packages that provide several different modes of driving which are really something very noticeable, not just on paper statements. On other cars I tried and on my wife's Z4 those are also present, nothing new, but while you can feel the difference on other cars I feel its rather much more dramatic on 340ix. So, starting with these modes:First, they indeed can be useful and I do switch between them in different conditions. Second, I cant say I'm particularly happy about them. I would be perfectly fine with one perfectly tuned suspension and steering. Which was the case in my 2012 335iS, frankly having the ideally  tuned suspension and steering, better than any other car I tried so far (better even than in M3 and maybe better than Porsche Boxter). I don't know how they managed that but they did with 335is - exceptionally smooth, absorbing all the major road imperfection and at the same time razor sharp with just heavy enough and firm steering to feel the road and keep things under absolute control. Simply a joy to drive. Why BMW would not just stick with it?? People just keep saying that new BMW cars generation lost this handling edge but BMW stubbornly ignores that. And these modes are:1. ECO Pro - it could be even Eco Pro Pro or super pro or whatever else BMW marketing call them there would still be nothing 'Pro' here. This mode turns your BMW into Toyota Primus. It reduces the engine response to the gas pedal and add a bunch of indicators on display to let you sort of play some computer game, giving some saved miles bonuses, plots and tips, etc. Warning if you press too hard on accelerator pedal or exceed some speed limits. I played around with it while breaking in the car but frankly I can't see what an idiot (pardon) would buy BMW to drive it in Eco mode. 2. Comfort mode - that mode is actually better than on 335 or Z4. It feels a little firmer and more steerable. But still not what I would consider providing a good BMW-like driving experience. It provides reasonable engine output (press the pedal and you really go) and its smooth but IMHO a little bobbing on bumps and the steering is just too overpowered and soft which makes you a little nervous on high speeds. I still use it in rush hour and maybe its OK to use on gravel roads or something. But its still nowhere close to the standard 335is experience, worse than Z4 comfort mode and I would even prefer Mercedes 320Sport driving to that. It reminds me Buick leSabre on steroids. The worst part of it - its a default mode. You cant change it. Why??? Both Audi and Mercedes let you choose whats default, its all software. Mercedes even let you customize the parameters of the mode to choose your preferences. Why am I forced to drive in comfort mode the car most would buy for sporty behavior? That's plain stupid. Its the same on Z4.  So if you bought the car not to show that you can buy luxury car but to indeed enjoy performance ride then you need not to forget to hit the mode button every time you start engine. That will give you a Sport mode. 3. Sport mode increases the responsiveness of the engine,",
  "bmw_3-series_2016": " I purchased a white 320xi. It comes with 4 years free maintenance. It's my first BMW, comfortable, quick, and very smooth. I wanted a compact car, but I also wanted a solid car that looks good, and is safe, reliable, and fun to drive.  The 320xi has plenty of power for me. It took 800 plus miles on the engine until I could feel it begin to break in. The design is very pleasing to the eye -- exterior , interior. The controls are logical, and easy use. I have the Sensatec faux leather which I think is excellent. I prefer it over leather in some ways, mostly because I think leather has a strange smell. I think it is a good quality, solid car, and a good value for the money. Excellent build quality. I did, however, trade it in for a Mercedes Benz E350, that has more comfortable seats and doesn't ride so low. (I traded the E350 for a Porsche Macan, that I think has a more heavy duty suspension, and more comfortable seats.) I have two negative opinions: First, no spare tire came with the car, and I'm not comfortable with that and second, I found it difficult to get in and out of the 320xi, and the seats gave me a back ache. I would still recommend it, it just wasn't the car for me.",

First, the wagon looks gorgeous and is very distinctive with its Estoril Blue color and Coral Red interior. The 250 hp G-48 engine purrs along with a pleasant sound and is very fast.  At 90 mph the car is smooth and rock-steady. The ride is a nice balance between comfortable and firm. The safety tech and version 5.0 infotainment features are state-of-the-art. What really brings it all together from a handling and comfort standpoint is the adaptive suspension, which is a no-brainer at $1000.

Same case here - I have all the packages except cold weather (does have heated seats) including the 'M' package. More active suspension and acceleration....handles great.  Setting the level here though...this vehicle has so much technology that after reading the manual a couple of times, I still had a few questions for the dealership.  I'm a technology professional by trade so that appeals to me but for the non-tech types, the technology and/or communications package may be overkill since you'll probably never use the services.  My parents own an X5, are not tech savvy and barely use all the features available...just a point to consider.

  "bmw_5-series_2016": " I bought my first BMW in 2014, a 4 cyl diesel. My other two cars are a 2014 Prius Sedan and a 2014 Prius V. I have owned GM's, Fords, Cadillac's, Jeeps, but for some reason I like diesel engines better. The first BMW,  I absolutely fell in love with that car. I got 40mpg in town and 45 to 46 mpg on the highway. The car was so good, I wanted bigger, and decided to buy the 2016 BMW 535 diesel with the 6 cylinder engine. BMW did not skimp on quality or luxury with this car. I have never had any maintenance problem with BMW's, I keep my cars properly serviced and inspection clean. I get better mileage then what BMW says on their sticker, because, just like a Prius, you have to learn HOW to properly drive one.  Some pro drivers don't like the cut off feature when the vehicle is stopped, and restart, but it never bothered me. It's a fuel saver. BMW diesel engines make very little noise. They are a pleasure to drive, and the car remains tight and noise free. The technical features are numerous but only add to the enjoyment of the vehicle. Just take a test drive in either the gas or diesel and you will see what I'm talking about.  Note: I wrote this review last year at age 72. My opinion remains the same. Only the millage has changed.",

  "bmw_7-series_2016": " a BMW.  This truly is the best car I have ever owned.  I have previously had MB, Jag, Audi, Jeep, Acura, etc.  I went into this thinking it was going to be an S Class or a Model S.  (Both great cars in their own right) However, after driving the S I couldn't shake the feeling that it felt old.  Anyone who chose that car got a great one it just wasn't for me, and this is after aspiring to an S my whole life.  I drove the Tesla Model S and loved the acceleration and Auto Pilot, but it felt very cramped and the materials are not even close to 5 series quality let alone the 7.  I liked the Tesla but feared I would get tired of the tradeoffs.  I drove the 7 and knew I had to have it. It is extremely fast, very comfortable, and has a decent percent of the autonomous capabilities of the then Model S.   After 8,000 miles, I can honestly say I still love it. I'm getting about 19 mpg around town and 29-30 when I do long highway hauls.  Pretty darned impressive for a dual turbo V8 that will haul A*% when needed.",
  "bmw_7-series_2016": " I was looking for a new car for quite some time, as my M5 E60 was becoming a classic and I needed more comfort, better gas milage and front massage seats. I test drove Tesla P85D, Mercedes S-class and they didn't impress me - heavy cars with bad corners handling. When I first test drove 740i it really impressed me with lightness and super easy handling of the steering wheel. It is a big car, but driving it feels like it is not - engine, transmission, suspension combination is absolutely flawless. I now have 1000 miles on it and drove it for one month and love it every time I see it and I drive it. Technology and iDrive are top-notch, giving you a feeling of a spaceship, and not quite a car. The only shortcoming includes no full integration with Apple products (no screen mirroring and bad connectivity via bluetooth), which works great with Android products. Another shortcoming is lack of unlimited WiFi for the car from ATT - for some reason all you get is 10GB.",

Not hating them, I have an SL550, but the BMW is un paralleled as a daily driver or on a trip. I had a BMW before and hated iDrive, but love the new system. The air conditioner is excellent, the new interface is more friendly, and visibility in the car is excellent. Give one a try....you will be glad you did!",

The car is priced well with some discount offered by dealer. However, there are some options priced high and if you are using it, it does not matter but since I am not using those options such as lane keeper and lane change warning, I do not think this is worth of having.

  "bmw_7-series_2016": " Since 1996 this is my third seven series.  This one is a cheap one, corner shortcut features, and I hate to say that I hate it.  Let's start with the stupidest item first, that is the trunk key that in all cars, it closes the trunk, in this car it is designed to lock the doors, therefore, useless. The doors of all high end cars open when the driver opens the driver's side door, but in this car you also have to push to unlock button to open the other doors.  Seats are cheap and no support. Dash is simple flat like old American cars. Cockpit isn't designed like a BMW signature, and cant's see the small digits of temp, hour, and other information. The radio is the worst I have ever seen. The service says it's because it's a satellite radio and it sucks in all  seven series. Don't know if that is true, or they just don't want to do anything about it. The performance isn't like prior models, and the body looks like a whale simple and a long box. I was debating between this and a Maserati , and  chose this because of promotional monthly lease and  included service.  You get what you pay for!",

I called the service dept multiple times and finally got through.  She said to restart the car. The last 5 or 6 times this happened it took half a dozen to a dozen restarts.  I had to turn it off and get out, lock it to put it in hibernation and restart.This is happening more and more with this car.Other issues:-Cruise control will shut off completely on the expressway when you hit a bump.  Have to turn it back on and set it again.-moonroof rattles and squeaks, sounds like a ten year old clunker.  Have to vent it to stop the noise.  Closing the sun shade muffles the noise.-camera's fail for parking.  360 and either front or back camera's. ",
  "bmw_7-series_2016": " I bought my 7 Series X-Drive with the big V-8, here in Colorado, in early March 2016. I drove this car from Colorado to Palm Springs, CA, shortly after my purchase, and was just amazed at its performance and handling. I traded in a Porsche Panamera 4S (2012) and that was a great car, designed (I think) with my demographic in mind. I'm 75 years old. Before the Panny, I drove 3 Audi A8 L's.This is an incredibly high-tech car, and I discover new things about its innards almost daily. The BMW organization practically fawns over me as a buyer of its top-priced sedan, and I guess I like that. I also really like the full maintenance warranty, so - unlike Porsche-Audi's ",

I would have opted for the Alpina B7 had it been avail but due to timing I opted for a 750i xDrive.  Although not quite as fast as the much more expensive Benz I traded, this car is far more engaging and athletic to drive. The 4.4L V-8 is silky smooth and the transmission programming is spot on. On a car with as much technology as these high-end sedans have, I much prefer the interfaces and user-friendliness of BMW's approach to controls, infotainment, and gizmos (exception of the seat controls.... MBZ has the best placement for seat controls).  The drive settings provide a cadre of options ranging from pillow soft to firm. Perhaps I haven't discovered how yet but I'd like the car to stay in the mode I last drove it in (defaults to comfort every time I start it up). In all drive settings the car performers admirably on road trips over varied pavement. I do notice more dramatic pitch from the front suspension than I am used to in a BMW under hard braking or hard acceleration.  I don't opt for the 21",

I was given a 2016 7 loaner and that died tooxe2x80xa6..coincidence or is someone trying to tell me something?

I will say that the interval materials feel a bit less quality wise than my 550...was built in 2008.   They have made some other refinements that balance the overall experience.  I am a lifelong bimmer enthusiast.Update: 6/14/16I am in love!  I really have no complaints about the car.  I did have to add radiator fluid...which is weird for this year model.  I will see if that problem repeats itself.  So far so good!  The learning curve is sharp with this car as the technology is very advanced.  I must retract my comment above based upon horsepower because I have now driven the 750 and the difference in driving experience definately does not justify cost.

  "bmw_i3_2016": " Before buying this, be clear on the actual miles you drive in any given week and when/where you can charge. I really like my i3 but I drive very few miles in any given week ( 50). So I don't need to charge the car very often. There are chargers at my work but not in my apartment complex. If I have to charge at home, I need to use some chargers down the street (which is fine because they're free!) I've had it over a month now and have yet to use the range extender. However, I still find myself with slight anxiety about making sure the car is charged enough - I'm hoping this will dissipate with time. I'm not a fan of the coach doors in the back. If you are parked side to side with other vehicles and open the front door and coach door at the same time, you're sort of trapped in the triangle while trying to get things out of the back seat. The trunk is much smaller than my Honda Fit. It barely fit my large suitcase. But I knew all of these things before I purchased so I can't complain. The car has amazing acceleration - really impressive. It's also super quiet. Wish the AC was a bit stronger - it just doesn't blow very hard even at the highest setting (likely because AC drains the battery a lot).",

Unfortunately, there is not any other car I could find that would compare to the Passat for MPG and interior room. I test drove a BMW 5 series and was disappointed, I felt claustrophobic and just didn't seem right. So I decided to try the i3, boy was I surprised! It doesn't have the back seat room like my VW, but it's fun to drive, gets amazing fuel(kW) mileage, and seems to fit my life style just fine. I opted for the REx version and glad I did. I have made a few trips with my family(wife and two kids) no problem. Even a Costco run!",
  "bmw_i3_2016": " Our i3 has taken us over 21,000 miles- 98+% of it on battery- EV mode. The Range Extender eliminates the anxiety of those last miles before the charger.

I've driven over 100 miles and still had 37% percent battery charge left.  The new color option of protonic blue is a great step forward.  Pick-up 0 to 30 is outstanding though you will feel the road and bumps a little much.  Previous reviews on ride comfort hold true for the battery refreshed 2017.

It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 , 1 to Santa Monica  that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!!  For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation.  I've lowered the car 3/4",

My wife refuses to drive it anymore. The garage door opener was impossible to set. I gave up. I have set it for years on American cars. The electronics or command in center console not user friendly. I would never buy another BMW or German car. American cars are much more user friendly.",

The vehicle design is stunning, top up or down, and the views from all sides always bring a smile and a thumbs up from onlookers. The 575 HP produces startling acceleration and the instant choice between automatic and paddle lets you control as much as you like, with the manual so much fun that you feel like a kid again. Engine sounds are thrilling. Brakes are simply awesome, and the very slight understeer from the RWD gives you the feeling of being in complete control at all times. Quality of all finishes is meticulous, and the sound system is symphony hall level. The M6 is simply state of the art, and the only downside is that there are so few roads where this sensational beauty can be driven to its full potential. Fantastic.",

Please at least go and test drive one and you will be amazed. The lighting at night is really neat. Also, BMW rebuilds their cars on the inside, not some new plastic molding like other car companies. Get it! Enjoy it! I just wanted to let people know. I've never written a review before... yeah I like it that much.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " Every car is a series of compromises.  In the areas that are priorities to me - safety, quality, performance - the X1 scores well.  Its chief limitations are modest cargo capacity and a somewhat cramped (for adults at least) rear seat.  However, given that the X1 has a footprint barely bigger than a Prius, it is roomy by the standards of small vehicles.  If you need substantial cargo capacity you should look at the X3 or X5.  If you need to seat adults in the rear seats on a regular basis look at the X3 or ensure that you get an X1 with the sliding/reclining rear seat option.  But for my family only small children sit in the back, and the standard X1 is just about ideal.  We have a second car which is a good deal larger than the X1.  Parking tends to be difficult where we live, and it is significantly easier to find a parking place for the X1 than it is to find a parking place for the larger vehicle.  Fuel economy is noteworthy, I did not believe the stated 32mpg on the highway was really achievable, but we took a road trip with the X1 and I can report that figure is absolutely attainable.  Overall great small SUV.",

  "bmw_x1_2016": " I had a 2014 X1 (prev generation) that was my favorite car ever, but was coming off lease. I expected this new generation of X1 to be fair since it was being molded to look like the rest of the X-line family (truth be told, I wanted the Tesla Model 3 but couldn't wait that long). I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is actually more fun than the last one. Slightly less horsepower, yet the 0-60 is quicker. The move to a front-wheel-emphasized 4WD is not noticeable. I sometimes miss the hydraulic steering (however, the 2016's adaptive steering makes parking and city driving much easier). I got every tech package except the ACC (c'mon, an extra thousand, really?) and it seems worth it. By adding a few extra PSI to the tires (compared to the door sticker), I am getting 35+ MPG on the highway! Eco-mode is much more useful now without sacrifice (I especially didn't like the jolt on the 2014 when I needed to pass someone on the highway due to the shift timing change in this mode). The interior materials are a step up (interior lighting at night is especially top notch). The rear view is crowded compared to previous gen (due to smaller rear window and seat back obstructions), but not dangerous. The front seats are narrower than the last model and could use a little more cushioning as well - make sure you like them first vs. ordering the sports seats/package. I am 5'8 at 175 pounds so the base seats work for me. Overall, It's more luxurious, quieter and more fun than the previous generation (which was already great).

  "bmw_x1_2016": " I've had a 328, 528, and now a X1.  I have the MSport pack (Estoril Blue), Tech, Cold Weather, and Driver Asst packages.   The SAV (as Munich likes to call it) is/has everything I need in a car.  Most importantly, I don't have to fold down the seats to put two golf bags in the back.  My favorite attributes about BMW is the familiarity with the iDrive system and it's the only manufacturer in this segment where the passenger can enter an address into the Nav while the car is in drive.  I test drove Lexus/Audi and both required the car to be in park in order to enter an address into the nav (unless I wanted to use the voice recognition - which is always terrible)!  Anyway, this car is typical BMW - high end interior parts and all of the controls are where they should be.  Now I do have ONE gripe - the temperature controls only move in two degree increments and in even numbers only.  I contacted BMW about this and it's because the car is based off the MINI Countryman.  Let's not forget, this is an entry level BMW, so it's not the biggest deal for me.  Overall, I'm glad I got this SAV.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " Let me preface by saying my last three cars were Hondas. I wanted an upgrade with more pep and more luxury. So here goes - The Good: Acceleration - Amazing, Interior Space - Amazing (overall same length as my Honda Civic but the interior feels MASSIVE), the Technology package with bluetooth, handsfree phone etc. - Great, the Steering - Fantastic. OK The Bad - After two weeks the tow-hook cover in the front fell off, never to be seen again. Rear Visibility: Not great. Parking Assist - I live in LA and you really have to hurry your parking cause there's always someone behind you. The parking assist is either slow in figuring out there's a spot or it never figures it out. Pointless. Fuel Consumption - Not Great At All, I have it on Eco Mode most of the time and my average after 4000 miles with about 1000 highway no traffic driving is 22.3 mpg. The Ugly: The seats are TERRIBLE. The Ride is also TERRIBLE probably due to the runflat tires and maybe the suspension. I started researching how to replace the seats and the tires. Yes, it's that bad.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " The good: it's faster than other similarly sized small suv's and has good bmw looksThe bad: these are the worst seats. my test drive seemed ok but once you sit in them for a while you know. it's like sitting on a flat park bench.  sport seats are only available in the m package, which dealers here don't order",

  "bmw_x1_2016": " I was cross shopping the Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, BMW X3, and Volkswagen GTI. And then I saw this new X1. I was thinking to wait for the next gen Q5, but I decided to buy this car. It's a handsome car inside out. The interior is very spacious. The headroom and legroom are comparable or even bigger than the current Q5, GLC, X3, and GTI. It's even comparable to the larger X5. (X5 vs X1: F head 40, 41.9 R head 39.3, 39.4 F leg 40, 40.4 R leg 36.6, 37) I am 5'10, 165 lbs, I fit in the back seat comfortably even when the front seat is all the way back. And my car is not even with the sliding rear seat option. The trunk is also big, fits $200+ groceries from Costco easily. The engine is potent. The transmission is smooth. The handle is nimble. The acceleration is quick. It's fuel efficient. Overall it's a very practical car. I understand it's being categorized as a subcompact SUV/SAV, but you really have to test drive and get inside of the car to understand what I'm talking about. It's BIG!!! OK, now the bad. The front seat is too narrow. The gas pedal is too close to the side wall of the center console. The center console storage is relatively small. There is still noticeable turbo lag when stop and go. The suspension is too hard, you can feel every tinny hole and bump on the road. The LED headlight and taillight only come with the premium package, and the price is pretty premium for that.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " I looked at the Mercedes GLA, Audi Q3, and BMW X1.  The 2016 BMX X1 was by far the best.  A very practical vehicle, with excellent cargo and passenger room for a compact SUV.  Excellent performance and gas mileage from the 4 cyl turbo engine.  BMW handling and overall driving experience  is an added bonus.  I have owned two BMW 3 series sedans.  The handling is not as good a these, but the handling is better than any other compact SUV I have driven. The most value for the money compared to other luxury compact SUVs.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " Got stuck in a lease with one of these, I immediately regretted it. BMW must be paying for positive reviews, because it' not that stellar of a vehicle. The car has stylish looks, has many bells and whistles, and is fun to drive in Sport mode, but that's about it - everything else is like driving a typical 4-cylinder, kind of boring and sluggish. The worst part about the X1 is the interior comfort and design. The front seats are the worst I've ever seen, they have ZERO padding, way too firm like sitting on a park bench, they're also too narrow and high. The leather is very grippy and not smooth, tugs your shirt. The steering wheel obstructs the dashboard, you can't get a clear view of the entire instrumentation through the top hole of the steering wheel. The controls for the screen and navigation are horrible and feel 20 years old. Selecting single letters or digits to input an address into the nav? Forget it. It's also unsafe having to look down at the control wheel and buttons instead of up. I would not describe the whole system as intuitive at all. Outside temp only visible to the driver, no digital speedometer, annoying. The on-wheel radio controls are not the easiest to set up or navigate. The whole cabin instrumentation is just overcomplicated, and kind of Frankensteined with new and old. The screen looks like it should descend, but it doesn't, it's kind of unsightly like it's tacked on. MPG is so-so unless you drive in Eco mode which turns engine off at stops. Overall very disappointed with the X1. It looks like a BMW on the outside, but it isn't on the inside.",

Since we already own 2 other BMW's, we were aware that the maintenance cost would be at the high end.  But we'll still be driving this car when all the others are razor blades!",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " 3500 miles in and 5 stars in all aspects.  Based on my experience, it lives up to BMW's billing...best in class performance, fuel economy and cargo.  I evaluated other comparable models (Lexus NX, Acura RDX, Mercedes GLA, and Audi Q3) and chose the BMW X1.  Car and Driver rating 4.5 out of 5.It's roomier on the inside than it appears from the outside.  For both rows of seats, it actually has more head and leg room than the current BMW X3.  I highly recommend the optional sliding 2nd row seat to gain flexibility for passengers versus cargo.Well-engineered and easy to use information technology (iDrive, bluetooth, Navigation, etc.).  I didn't spec the safety technologies, so I can't comment on them.Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " Ok small SUV, but noisy on the freeway,  some cheap bits in the interior and harsh ride. Dealers are not willing to move of MSRP much and it's just not worth the purchase price. Poor value for the money.",

I was never at one the gas was so good. they changed the x1 this year and made an awesome SUV would highly recommend  this car.",
  "bmw_x1_2016": " I'm a new owner (bought a month ago), and have been pleased with the car so far in 1800 miles of driving. Admittedly, my previous car was a Scion, so any car in this range would have been a big step up. But I really enjoy the performance of the X1 - lots of extra power so that I can pass on the highway going uphill (I drive to Tahoe regularly). The traction works well in the snow so far. And it gets surprisingly good fuel efficiency - I mostly drive on the highway, and get 29-30 mpg on average. And I love the parking sensors - the rear-view camera, and the sonar to know when I'm getting close to obstacles while parking, are essential for parking in close quarters. The lumbar support is key as well on the long drives that I do. The controls (turn signals, windshield wipers, etc) are a bit funky and different than most cars so they take some time to learn, but I like the console control for the screen. And the Bluetooth integration with my phone works great for both playing audio and taking phone calls. So far, so good!",

  "bmw_x1_2017": " Love this car, did lot of research and decided to order this car. The reason I ordered the car is because of the color and i wanted the sport package that has the sports seats. I did not like the regular seats at all, and my advise to all is that for 2017 you can order the car with sports seats, i would have not bought this car otherwise. I got this car loaded except for the driver assistance package with is worthless in NYC.  I only have a couple of minor gripes about this gorgeous car. The first one that when i picked up the car at the performance center i found out that the media system does not have a hard drive and my second grype is that the car does not a a space for sunglasses, so I use the cubby hole in the drivers side door. This car looks luxurious and great with the sport package big difference over the regular one. it is worth the extra money for the looks and suspension. One more thing I would love to see this car with a bigger engine and a diesel option.",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " I recently got into a 2017 X1 and it was a huge mistake. After test driving the car a few times I decided to transition from my 328i into an X1 as I was looking for more space and comfort. After driving off the lot and sitting in the car for 15 minutes I immediately noticed the seat was off. THESE ARE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEATS. The driver's seat is now causing me BACK PAIN which I've had to visit a chiropractor to help manage. Unfortunately, both the dealer and BMW corporate have not been helpful - they claim there's nothing they can do to help me. I unfortunately will have to to exit my lease early and get into another make and model.",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " Take car out for a day drive.",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " We shopped around for quite some time looking for a small/midsize crossover. We test drove literally dozens of vehicles: Mazda, Audi, Benz, Honda, Ford, to name a few. We were between the Volvo XC 60 and the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. We loved the Volvo but the price at $52K out the door was a little more than we were willing to pay. We were about to settle on the Hyundai (even though it didn't drive especially well) when the night before I read an article about the X1 and figured we'll go check it out before settling on the Hyundai. To our delight, we loved the way the X1 looked, drove, and its interior is bigger than it seems from the outside. The trunk was the biggest surprise to us with the underneath compartment. We loved the car. We compromised on the base X-Drive model MSRP of $36K but got them down to $33K. We took it home that night and have been enjoying it ever since. Nearly 1 month later, we have gotten a good feel for the X1. Our biggest complaints have to do with some basic features lacking in the base model which we knew going in. The fully loaded Hyundai had all the features I'm talking about i.e. LED Headlights, XM Radio, Blind Spot monitoring, Sunroof, backup camera, adaptive cruise, forward collision warning, integrated sunshades, heated seats, navigation to name some big ones. The X1 does have some of these features if you elect certain packages but the price will quickly climb into the 40's and beyond. Ultimately, we chose the BMW because it drove 100 times better than the Hyundai and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress up a Hyundai it is still a Hyundai and drives as such. We've been averaging 25MPG combined which is better than all the other vehicles we tried especially with an all-wheel drive. Besides our lack of options our only other complaint really is the suspension. As expert reviewers have stated, the X1's suspension is very stiff and you feel it when you go over speed bumps or bumps in the road. But I still prefer the stiffness over the squishyness of the Hyundai's body roll suspension. Another weird thing our X1 lacks is the ability to control the rear dome light from the rear. It's an odd design flaw but we'll get over it. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our decision.",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " I recently purchased a 2017 BMW X1 Xdrive.  I have previously owned (2) 3 series and (1) 5 series.  IMO, the 2017 X1 is the best value for the money of all the other BMW's I have owned.  It is not the best handling or planted to the road BMW I've owned, actually it is the least.  But, for its class, its absolutely the best handling and value for money.  For this class(small CUV), I actually prefer the front drive platform to give it the best overall use of space.  This little CUV(I consider it a cuv instead of SUV), because its actually more like a slightly raised hatchback or wagon but looks like a SUV.  The 2017 is slightly revised from the complete remodel in 2016.  The 2016 has a standard sport suspension but for 2017 they changed suspensions and made the sport or M suspension available as an option with the M sport package only.  I assumed I would like the 2016 better but after test driving the 2016 and 2017 models, I actually preferred the 2017 suspension better.  IMO, the 2016 is a little harsh and hard. I think the 2016 having a sport suspension and awd the handling is amazing but a little hard for many people interested in a suv. The 2017 has a more comfortable feeling but still offers terrific handling, especially for its class.  I really enjoy the std ",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " I traded a 2014 X1 for a 2017.... I saw it, it looks great! a big improvement, I got inside.. great, another big improvement across the board, really an aggressive/beautiful car inside and out.... then I drove it? wait a minuet, did I get in a BMW or Mercedes? a little less power than my 2014, noticeable in particular when accelerating while moving, such as passing, but even worse the shifting,... gone is the precision, satisfying, almost manual like shifts exactly where they should be in every situation, now shifting feels like standard Mercedes in eco mode, or other quality but soft car. I buy BMW partly due to driving experience, BMW missed a great opportunity to show us a front drive could feel like a BMW, this does not, donxc2xb4t get me wrong it is a great car, my wife likes it better, says it is more comfortable, and it is, but seat of the pants does not feel as good, it just does not feel 100% BMW due mostly to transmission personality.",
  "bmw_x1_2017": " previous owner of earlier bmw's, mini cooper S', porsche and ferrari, as well as a slew of others, I am compelled to disagree with earlier gentleman' statement about harsher ride, this X-1 we bought precisely because as a small cross-over this rides impeccably well, so much more than we ever anticipated, which is why we bought it! Keep it out of sport mode!  Or not I use it for performance purposes, my spouse does not, the choice is ours to make. We looked at four door clubman, f-pace jags, MB slams , c's, none do what this car does especially for the price, none!",

  "bmw_x1_2017": " My wife and I test-drove a 2017 X1 last week. Happily, we also test-drove an X3, which, in our opinion, made the X1 look terrible. She ended up buying a new X3, which she finds, at this point, to be a wonderful car. Anyway, I own a 2013 X1, which I like very much. I have nothing but good to say about it. But the 2017 we drove  was definitely a different car from mine. It looks pretty much the same, although I think it is a little larger. The turbo-four still has the nice kick to it. But the ride was hard -- bumpy and uncomfortable compared to my 2013 and especially compared to the X3 we drove. So, if you are interested in an X1, keep in mind that you are considering a car so different from the older X1's that perhaps it should have been renamed.",
  "bmw_x3_2016": " We bought the X3d for several reasons 18 months ago.  1/ Diesel's are known for their good MPG, we get 33 mpg on and off HWY. We are not very often at the Gas Station and get an average 680 miles from empty to full.  2/. Servicing is only every 10,000 miles or 1 year and our Local BMW Dealership is only 10 miles from home. Very convenient.  3/. Insurance is reasonable and with all the safety aspects we get 36% discount.  4/. Road Side Assistance is all in for 10 years. Part of the deal.  BMW give you 4 years Free Maintenance  but we offered to pay for an extra 2 years having taken the finance over 6 years. Thus when we have to pay for 7th Maintenance our car will be paid off. The car is a delight to drive and the twin turbo kicks in well when needed. Snow and ice are no problem.  X3diesel is always going to hold a good resell factor as a good one is very hard to find. Wife has a mixed back roads and R93 to get to work and when there are delays the GPS finds a way for her for the 20 mile journey each working day.  Our back up car is a 2012 Acura RDX and on par with BMW X3d.",

I was looking to buy the Range Rover Evoque but after reading reviews and noticing BMW had more bells and whistles, plus reliability, I couldn't have made a better choice. It's roomy on the inside which I love. I wanted an SUV but didn't want to feel like I was driving a bus, so I went with this model. I've had this car for almost a month and I LOVE it!",
  "bmw_x3_2016": " There are a lot a good features about the BMW X3, but overall if I had the decision to make all over again I would choose something else.  First the good things.  1) The power from the 3.0L turbo is very good.  It is refined and the transmission shifts smoothly.  2) The active stop and go cruise control is worth the extra cost.  When you are sitting stop and go traffic it is a wonderful feature.  3) Back seats and cargo capacity are very good for this class of SUV.  4) I-Drive is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  5) Heads up display is a great feature.  I have it on another car and think more vehicles should have this as an option.Now for the things that I am disappointed with after having this BMW for a few months.  1)  The upgraded Harmon Kardon system sounds just OK.  I had a Harmon system in a Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and it rocked in comparison to this system.  At louder volume levels the sound is a bit harsh.  2) The keyless entry system can be a bit flakey.   With the key in my pocket I have issues opening and locking the door.  I have to take the key out of my pocket to make it work.  I don't have this issue on my GM with a keyless system.   Plus for a vehicle of this price point, I think its kind of cheap to not have them on the rear doors too.  3) Both rear tail lights have flaws from the molding process.  I have looked at others and you can barely see the injection points in the lens, but mine stand out like sore thumb.  They look like white dots on the tail lights.  The dealer says they are in spec.  Again for the price of these SUV's is seams these could be made better.  4) Went I got it I thought the interior was nice and was fitting of the luxury brand.  But over time, some the materials feel cheep.  Even with upgraded leather, the ruff texture makes it feel like fake leather.  It was not until I got in my friends new Cadillac XT5 did I really notice the difference.   The Cadillac is light years ahead on interior quality.  I can feel the ruff seam on the top and bottom of the turn signal stalk where the two pieces of plastic meet.5) No vented front seats and power tilt/telescoping wheel.  A miss on this class and price point.6) Auto Start/Stop is poorly programmed.  Many times it stops the moment you stop.  There should be a couple of seconds delay.  When coming to a stop sign or switching gears while pulling into a parking space, I have had the engine shut off just to restart again while it was shutting off.  Then there are times when you think it should shut off and it does not.   I have stopped and put it into park and it won't shut off.  The only plus is you can disable the feature.  I highly recommend this if you have the A/C on.7) Front parking sensors are slow to engage.  Don't pull up to something quickly and expect them to be active.8) Having to hit the Start/Stop button twice to shut everything off is annoying.  Once to stop the engine the second time to turn off accessories.  If you don't the accessories stay on even after you open the door.  It will timeout once you have locked the door, but I don't trust it.  You should only have to hit it once to turn the engine off.  Then when you open the drivers door it shuts off the accessories. 9) It was not until I a took a long trip and my left leg started falling asleep how bad the comfort is on the bottom of the front seats.  They are not good.  The cushion is too short on the front and sides. 10) Just got the recall notice about the rear child safety seat anchor.  Give this vehicle is been on the market for a while I am surprised that this has come up this late in the product cycle.  What concerns me how they have to fix this.  They need to remove the rear seats and carpet, send it out a body shop to have a support bracket welded in.  Not liking the sound of welding something in a brand new vehicle.***UPDATE***I traded the BMW in after 6 months.   When you spend this kinda money on a car and are not happy with it you need to go with something else.   The something else is a 2014 Cadillac CTS Vsport with under 25K miles.   This is an amazing car.   Can't wait to get into it each day and drive.   This is what a luxury car should be.",

I was almost seduced by the Evoque, but reading all of the owner horror stories scared me away. I took delivery of my X3 in December 2015 and have already put about 7500 miles on the vehicle. Thus far, the X3 has performed flawlessly and has not disappointed! Initial build quality appears to be worthy of the price tag.I've found the xDrive system to work very well on the road during inclement weather (heavy rain, light snow), although I did not have to put it to the test in deep snow. I do not have the Dynamic Handling Package, but given how well the X3 handles the road without it, I'm not really sure how much of a difference I might notice with it. I've read other reviews where some felt the ride was too harsh, but I don't share that opinion, although I do like to feel the road perhaps more than some might.

After adjusting the seats I find them very comfortable (Nevada leather).  The interior design is classy, although some of the buttons are difficult to see from the driver's seat.

The idrive infotainment system is complex, but most functions work by voice command and it works well.  The build quality is excellent and there are no rattles, even from the panoramic sunroof.  The suspension is firm, well composed and comfortable.  The auto Stop/Start works well and definitely saves fuel at those long traffic lights.

I would have accepted almost any BMW, but are now the proud owner of a 2016 x3 all wheel drive. If I lower the seats to its lowest position I feel I am driving a sports car! In reality I raise the seat about halfway and it feels like I driving a luxury car. We needed the space in the back and its very generous for the size of vehicle, and there is still plenty of rear seat legroom. Drives great, looks great and costs great but its worth it.",
  "bmw_x3_2016": " My wife and I drove many cars before we decided to buy the 2016 X3, including Lincoln, Lexus, Infiniti, Cadillac. Not one of the others handled and accelerated like the BMW. The safety ratings on this car is better than the others too. The cost of the X3 was lower and the reviews from previous years we're very good and convinced us to buy it. This is a very fun and comfortable car to drive!",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " The menu system on a BMW dashboard is not intuitive - it's just a random annoyance that's the most consistent feature of this vehicle for a driver.  With three clicks, you can turn it off, but it won't stay off.  Every time you start the vehicle, it will come back to annoy you xe2x80x93 first with a legal disclaimer and then an array of meaningless menu choices.  It's impossible to make the screen display something useful like a digital clock (a Kia will do that, but a BMW won't).  I'd settle for a BMW logo on the screen, but even that's not an option.The menu is loaded with choices leading quickly to lots of useless information, but changing the audio source for the stereo is 3-4 clicks and a couple of knob-spins away.  You'll find the FM/HD radio choice is in a different section of the menu than the CD player and Bluetooth devices.  Perhaps it's just German humor.Info that's more easily accessed includes the owner's manual (should you be reading that on the dashboard while driving?) and contact info for the BMW complaint center (maybe BMW owners use that one a lot?).  You can also schedule a service appointment with a random BMW dealership with just a couple of clicks.  But they can't fix your menu.Want to xe2x80x9csearch by picturexe2x80x9d and learn more about xe2x80x9cscrew thread for tow fittingxe2x80x9d on this car's front bumper?  That's literally choice #3 of 12 on an image of the vehicle, just two clicks and a quarter-spin away.  But once again xe2x80x93 is this info you should be using while the vehicle's moving?  However if you need to call your spouse, plan on pulling over to the side of the road and scrolling through the alphabet, because the xe2x80x9cfavoritesxe2x80x9d from your iPhone will not upload to this system and the voice-dial feature is erratic at best.I like a lot of things about my 2017 BMW xe2x80x93 great steering and acceleration, quiet and steady ride, nice lines, quality trim everywhere.  But the stupid, amateur-designed, useless menu stuck in the middle of my dashboard is a daily irritation that won't go away.  Yes, I'm a little obsessive xe2x80x93 but how many non-obsessive people buy BMWs?  I owned three Saabs.  This is my first BMW and my last.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " This is a wonderful car to drive!  I was looking at the X1s first.  I did a lot of research, read all kinds of reviews and took several test drives in the X1.  I had made up my mind and had an order all written up for the color and options I wanted.   The dealer was shooting a commercial on their 2016 service loaners with big markdowns and under 5K miles.  I asked its they were leasable.... not the 2016s but they had a couple 2017 service loaners that were.....  for the same lease price as the less equipped X1!  I took one for a test drive.... so much nicer and more comfortable than the X1.  I changed my mind and leased the X3 right then and there!  It is a comfortable, quiet and really fun to drive SAV.  Plenty of power and good gas milage too.... amazing!  Some long trips coming up and this will make them much more enjoyable.  Just go drive one!  I came off a Ford Escape lease and moved up to the X3.  The price difference really isn't that much for the big step up in comfort, quality and drivability.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " We bought drivers assistance plus package to include blindspot, lane changer warnings but they only activated at 35 MPH so driving locally do not work. The driver siide definitely has a blindspot on the left side but blindspot only works at the higher speeds and the navigation package was pre-requisite. All in all, a waste of $3,000.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " Bought my 2017 xDrive28 in October 2016 and have 10,500 on it in four months. Body integrity is exceptional and it's both fun to drive and comfortable. I ordered it from the dealer and surprisingly it showed up in less than five weeks, being U.S. manufactured. Didn't go for a lot of options, no sunroof, leather or whatever but  did get all the available safety options. I'm 73 years old and recognize that my reflexes aren't want they use to be so happy to get all the help I can. Very disappointed that automatic braking was not available. Had that feature on my 2015 Subaru Forester and I believe it should be mandatory on all new cars.  Very, very disappointed with BMW U.S.A. 's extended warranty procedures. I got talked into it at the dealer but decided to cancel it a few weeks later for a full refund as provided in the warranty manual. Just too expensive for what you get. Have gone round and round with the dealer and BMW corporate but still waiting for refund over three months after cancelling it. All and all I'm happy with the car. Is it worth twice as much as a Forester? Probably not but at my age and still working full time  I figure it's just a well deserved present for myself.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " I love this vehicle!  I have the x3 v6 msport.  Purchased in July last year and have about 6k miles.  It's so quick, it hugs the road, corners extremely well, and is so fun to drive.  The interior is comfortable and the technology was very easy to figure out.  I have a 4 year 50k warranty bumper to bumper.  The maintenance program went to 3 yr 36k for the 2017 model year, but ok with me.  I test drove so many vehicles before deciding and couldn't be happier with my choice.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " love the fact that a lease from BMW means no cost basic maintence",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " Technology controls are counter intuitive, hard to get used to and learn.   Miles per gallon 12? A bit low expect high gas bills.  Not all options working as they should and cannot be tested. Car is supposed to be highly customizable but isn't for some desired features.  Why should dealer tell you tires are run-flats that cost $200 only after the car was sold.",
  "bmw_x3_2017": " The previous reviewers of the BMW I believe are incorrect. BMW still has a 4yr/50,000 bumper to bumper warranty but for 2017 the included service or maintenance is only covered for 3/36,000. That is the main reason I wrote this review to clarify that. I have only had the X3 for 3 weeks and only driven it 300miles mainly because I own a Nissan Leaf and the 2 year free charging ends for me at the new year so I drive my leaf whenever I can. I can say that I seem to really love the BMW. I like nice things and new technology  and have had several loaded Kia's in the last 5 years because I got a lot for my money and didn't care what other people thought. My 2015 Sorento SX was loaded and I do miss my remote start already which was not an option on the BMW for all the things you can get. But I will say that everything just feels and sounds better in the BMW. Is it $10,000 better I can't say yet but for me if I am going to pay $550 to $750 to own not lease a car it is worth it imo to love what you are driving. I did love my Optima SX with the 2.0 turbo and it was only $400 per month with 0% interest but sometimes you just need to fit something more than you can in just a rear seat pass thru. I really didn't do much research before I bought it on Black Friday and  got $2500 off msrp and $1000 BMW rebate/cash/credit whatever you want to call it. So for the last 3 weeks I have been watching reviews and reading up and I can say I don't have any buyers remorse. The only thing I am used to is 0% with Kia and my Nissan but I guess 2.9% for 72 is the best BMW usually offers. I wanted the M Sport and a few other options. There were a lot of vehicles to chose from but only a few with the M sport package. I actually went in looking at the X1 because it really isn't that much smaller and the price was less. The 2018 X3 will be all new and probably larger to make it more different from the recently upgraded X1. I am happy to buy at the end of the current models cycle because hopefully all the bugs are worked out. The only X1 they had with the M sport was loaded with 2 packages I didn't want and was the great BMW astral blue but not my first choice. Nearby was the X3 I ended up with for only $4000 more and still over loaded but it had the 20",

  "bmw_x4_2017": " As a previous BMW owner (3 series X-drive diesel), I was familiar with the brand but wanted to get something that had a different style to it...thus I went with the X4 and boy I wasn't disappointed.  Yes, I've read the reviews of not alot of cargo space compared to the X3 and reduced visibility because of the way the rear end is sloped but so far neither of those items are concerns for me.  Cargo area is fine for grocery , mall shopping it's not like I'm purchasing a 50 flat screen tv everyday.  Rear visibility is good just use your mirrors.  But I did add the Driver Assist Plus package which gives me a bit more confidence in driving.  BMW's X-drive is very nice as it controls power to all 4 wheels and keeps the vehicle stable and in control during rain, snow, and icy conditions.  Overall I'm very happy with my lease and when it's time to make another choice, I'll be hard pressed to go back to a sedan or get another X4.",
  "bmw_x4_2017": " Before you buy this car test drive the Porsche Macan S and you will soon see that while the Macan might be better looking, the Bmw clearly has quicker  acceleration and a much lighter sports car feel.  The Macan felt heavy and sluggish.  On top of that an exhaust note similar to the M4.  This car is real fun to drive and it will blow off most SUV's/cars on the road and when your screaming by them with this exhaust backfire they look at you like what the .... was that?",

  "bmw_x5-edrive_2016": " I really love the BMW and we have 528I 2008 also. After we heard X5 e car is coming, we got so excited to buy it and got it. All my neighbor were happy for us too. Right after we bought the car, there's some broken fridge noise is coming from Car during driving with AC on. It was bit disappointed and got fixed. Little sound still bothered but try to believe E car has same problem.  My job is carrying lots of clothing most of time, so need bigger space and travel to  Irvine to LA a lot so had to concern about gas/mileage same time.  This car had to be perfect in my scenario. When I come home with my 2 kids(7 and 9 boys) and husband around 8:30PM, Car just stopped in middle of the road. Luckily it was near my home (on Pioneer road and Patriot way) and could move just stop and go shaking so hard.. our family got so surprised and I believe it is really dangerous. Couldn't imagine if it happened on Freeway.. We had loaner car 328 and it was so small to carry my stuffxe2x80xa6and missed my meeting during that 1st week. This is brand new carxe2x80xa6and BMW was one of top car brand in my opinion. After getting my car fixed report. And knew engine got took out and replaced fruid injector and car couldn't start at once..it got wet and dried up and do it again and again...OMG I really don't want to keep this car any more.During today my trip from LA to Irvine, felt many shakes between when engine try to stop to save gas... and some belt sound and loud noise, and dirty smell too....on and on..Most crazy thing is BMW can't help with above problems. They couldn't hear what i hear and feel the same way. My car still in the service now. Feeling horrible and disappointed so far for the BMW. Do not buy this car. My family's new car won't be BMW anymore.",
  "bmw_x5-edrive_2016": " Traded in a BMW 7 series and felt like I was upgraded.  We love the elevated seating and view, especially with the glass roof.  My distance to work is around 6 miles so often I never have the engine running in gas mode.  I have only filled the gas tank about four times in almost 12 mos.  I love the option to adjust the engine modes from all gas to hybrid to all electric.  The engine changing from electric to gas is almost imperceptible.  Very roomy and elegant inside.  I am over 6 foot and there is lots of head room.  Handles very well in almost all weather situations--we haven't had much snow to comment on winter driving.  Heated seats and steering wheel are a plus.  I plug the car into the 110V standard home outlet in my garage at night and it is usually fully charged in the morning.  Thinking of getting a second one for my wife who currently drives an Escalade.  Only drawback if there is one is the liftback door is split such that the upper 3/4 raises and then you have to lower the bottom 1/4 separately to have it fully open for sliding something larger into the cargo space.  Not sure why they didn't make it one liftback door.  I would buy another one and I am hoping that they will extend the all battery range from around 14 miles to a few hundred like the Tesla.",
  "bmw_x5-edrive_2016": " I bet this hybrid would exceed your expectation. my wife drives mostly local road for riding kids. I'm fueling once a 2 weeks. full tank delivers around 700miles range for our usage. smooth, quiet and fast riding and full of joy is guaranteed only when enough juice. once the juice ran out, the full of joy is suddenly stopped. it turns to a bit noisy Japanese SUV. but, Acceleration is still faster than Japanese SUV, thanks to fast/smooth shift. So, You should plug-in as much as you can. I've been to 800miles trip without charging, average mpg was 25mpg in case of mostly highway. I would say if you intend to drive it mostly long distance or travel, 6cylinder X5 would be better. but, if you drive mostly local short distance like riding kids or commute, you will see the excellent fuel efficiency.",

  "bmw_x5-edrive_2016": " 2016 X-5 Hybrid is our 5th X5 and a surprising step forward from our prior gas and diesel models. The batteries charge overnight and the drive can be full battery (so 50+ MPG) if you plan to be just around town. Mixed driving is about 30 MPG which for a vehicle this size is amazing. The steering seems distinctly smoother than our prior models, just extremely smooth. Brakes are awesome. Acceleration is indistinguishable from our gas and diesel priors, with plenty of torque always available. Storage capacity is completely comparable to our prior X5s despite the batteries storage requirements. Fast charging stations are quickly becoming more available. Finishes and quality overall and sound system are all BMW-level,  meaning state-of-the-art. Best warranty available anywhere, and the BMW Service in Springfield is always a pleasure. The Hybrid is the future for all BMW Models, and if the X5 Hybrid is typical, then the future is here now, and very welcome. Wonderful to own and drive.",
  "bmw_x5-edrive_2016": " The xDrive40e is the best overall luxury SUV on the market. Once you take it for a test drive you will understand. You have a Twin Turbo 4-Cylinder engine and a 20 Mile Hybrid motor that gives a you virtually gas free driving around town. On long trips, you can maximize the Hybrid motor by Coasting and Breaking to recharge the engine to guarantee less fuel usage. Overall performance is fantastic. Though the heaviest of the X5 line you do not see any lag from stop to start with the engine combination. Gas mileage I have experienced in the city with combined driving is 58 mpg and on long trips of 150 miles plus I average 29 mpg. The ride is extremely smooth and I catch myself going a little fast. The heads-up display keep me in check while driving. The interior is beautiful depending on the options you select. I have the Black Dakota Leather and it is beautiful. Seat comfort is fantastic as you have an array of adjustment options for comfort. Navigation is great. The 10 inch plus display makes things very easy to use. The infotainment system is easy to use and navigate thru while driving. The exterior is beautiful. Dual exhaust and the traditional BMW kidney grill topped off with the high quality paint options makes the X5 a no brainier for someone looking for a new SUV. Many people complain about the xDrive40e not having a 3rd row seat. But honestly, unless your putting two or three midgets in the back, a 3rd row makes no sense. All and all, the 40e is an amazing SUV. I drove the Mercedes GLE and compared the two detail to detail. If your over 60 and looking for a grocery getter, get the Benz. If your looking for Performance AND quality, get the BMW. One side note, iOS compatibility is POOR due to Apple limiting the iPhone. Very tough to get Text Messages and Emails on the infotainment with an Apple device.",
  "bmw_x5-m_2017": " I just came out of an M5.  This X5M is better.  It handles shockingly well despite being an SUV.  It telegraphs its limits better than the M5.  The interior is superb.  The iDrive and Bang and Olufsen stereo are wonderful.  BMW has done a great job in moving the iDrive platform forward.  The level of voice control over various functions has improved considerably over my '14 M5.  Fit and finish have been excellent and no complaints.  When you combine the performance and technology of this vehicle with the quotidian practicality of how much it can haul you will really want to consider it if in the market for a 5-series/E-class/S6-7 Audi.",

This is my Dailey driver and business car that rides like the 5 series and will pull my fishing boat on the weekends. This is a performance machine so don't expect exceptional mileage. When I drive the interstate at 70- 75 the mileage is 23 but around town 16-17 with all the starting and stops- heavy machine so you should expect it. My last 2012 was the diesel an I got 20 in town and 26 Highway. Amazingly got 12.5 pulling a boat 950 miles to Florida! I like the diesel but wanted a change. I'm a gear head and have a Corvette, so I enjoy performance and handling. You really cannot compare this to another V6 SUV, this V-8 with 440 hp can run with the Porsch SUV for 25k less.",

The interior was terrific and felt very luxurious.  The infotainment center seemed to work flawlessly with  a beautiful display.  My big issue with the X5 is the amount of cargo space.  I wanted to love this car so much I was trying to determine if I could overlook the cargo space, but it is just much too small.  I even decided to take with my large cooler on my second test drive to see if I could squeeze everything in.  For such a nice utility vehicle it would be better for BMW to find a way to double the cargo capacity.  A real third row is unnecessary, but real cargo space is.",
  "bmw_x5_2016": " I have had the BMW X5 for 7 months.  It rides comfortably.  The voice commands are still iffy and make mistakes.  I speak clearly with no accent and it still makes mistakes, especially on navigating and pulling up your phone contact list.  I drive 50% in traffic in Atlanta and 50% highway driving on GA 400.  The gas mileage on highway never gets above 18 to 19mpg.  The gas mileage in traffic gets 15 to 17mpg.  The average per the computer is 17.3 after 6 months.  I took the car in and the technicians said this is normal and there are no settings to improve the gas mileage other than using eco-boost.  I frequently use the eco-boost mode and it makes about .2mpg difference.  Very little. I am light on the throttle and brakes about 80% of the time, so I don't think that's a big factor. The technician said the advertised mpg from BMW is shown under ideal conditions on a track and going 55 miles per hour.  I wish BMW disclosed this when I first purchased the car. I end up filling my car twice a week now.  My wife's Lexus RX 350 is a comparable SUV and gets about 24 miles per gallon, with similar driving habits and good acceleration.  Its a much better deal.  Corvette gets better gas mileage which is pretty sad.  The only thing I like better about the BMW X5 over the Lexus RX350 is the entertainment system.  Much more intuitive and easier to use in BMW.  If that's not as important to you, then, save some money and get the Lexus.",

All I have to say with comparing the two is the X5 feels quicker and handles better then the sedan. If you enjoy driving your vehicle like a sports car then you have to option the Dynamic Handling Package. This package makes this vehicle feel like its a 3series. Makes this huge suv very nimble in the corners it's worth every penny. I also love the quality in the interior BMW has come along way with there interiors. Especially with the Mocha Nappa Interior gives the vehicle a very rich feel. I love this SUV in my opinion I don't think there is anything else out there for the price that compares to the X5 for performance, comfort, handling, , safety. I would recommend this SUV everybody!",

Here are a few gripes:  The tail gate will not open by waving your foot under the rear bumper for a completely hands free experience. This feature has been standard on all 5 series since 2012 and is especially useful for an SUV.  After years of developing and updating idrive, why does BMW not update the idrive compatibility and new features (i.e. Apple Play) automatically and remotely via the existing satellite connection?  Why are the front turn signals not LED like the 5 series sedans? We've owned several late model BMW's over the past few years.  We get the impression over the years the design has become more attractive, however the decreasing quality and cost cutting measures are getting more obvious.  We're tempted to try Audi products next time.  Our friends are impressed with their new Q7's and A4.",

  "bmw_x6_2016": " We have owned (4) prior BMWs (1 325IS and (3) Z4s) the latest was a 2013 Z4.  Loved the roadsters but needed something more practical yet sporty.  The 2016 X6 was the ticket.  We looked closely at the X4 but it was an odd size and would no meet our needs.  The X6 has plenty of headroom, front and rear seats.  It rides exceptionally well and is incredibly smooth.  It is very agile for its size, trust me I know agile having (3) Z4s and this car is agile.  It moves well, has excellent, smooth acceleration when you need it and is a pleasure to drive.  We have the 35is motor and in my opinion is all you need.  We have been to the mountains with a load for two people and had no trouble so I wouldn't recommend the 8 cylinder and the extra fuel consumption that goes with it.  My wife was worried that she would miss her roadster and she has said now numerous times that she loves her X6, loves how it looks and drives.  The only gripe we have I that it is a little tricky to get in and out of since it does not have a upper handle but not a big problem and you get used to it.  Everything else about this car has been outstanding and far better than I thought it woud be.  Also,  we get constant comments on how nice of a car it is from neighbors, friends and strangers so that is fun.  We own the white X that does not have the M body but has the aluminum running boards.  Hope this is helpful for you if you are considering this vehicle.",

To me the ultimate car for the money is a GTI, or maybe a truck if you want the ultimate in utility. But let's say you can afford to splurge on a luxury car... why would you get an X6? Well, first off I have a truck. And a sports car(911). And a wagon(BMW 530). But the wagon is getting older and it was time for a replacement. So naturally I got the X6M as the ultimate wagon. That was a little over a year ago and when it was time to get rid of my wife's third row SUV(Mercedes GL550) for something smaller she decided on... another X6! This time the six cylinder X35i. I was surprised. But this is a surprising vehicle. Don't believe what they say about its storage space, there is a ton, trust me. Like fill up two shopping carts at Costco and fold down the rear seats and watch the X6 swallow it all, space. Which brings me to the X5's cargo space. This is the same car as the X5, just without the tall rear, so in the x5 you really only gain the space above the cargo area where you would stack stuff, and then you can't see out the back window. If you have one vehicle that extra space in the x5 might be important, but if you have a truck or don't usually buy big items you won't miss it. As I said the X6 has a LOT of space in its own right. Also, don't believe what they say about the rear seat room. I'm 6ft. tall and there is three inches of room above my head, and a large amount of legroom. The back seat is actually much more comfortable than the X5's which feels a little like a bench. Now for the good stuff... The X6 is an incredibly fun vehicle to drive. I have a 911. I have an X6M. I know fun. The 35i is a potent engine with great throttle response and a sublime transmission. The suspension is firm, never harsh and entices you to drive this thing like a race car. The brakes are stout. The steering is not 911 or X6M great but it's pretty good and the really the only thing drive-wise they could improve in my opinion. The steering is too light but if you're not jumping out of a 911 or X6M or GTI or BRZ you might not realize that it's not perfect. Want to go off-road? I drove an X3 through the off-road course at the BMW plant in South Carolina and trust me you can do a lot with the x-series BMW's. I go to Moab. I drive Jeeps on their gnarly routes. The X6 won't do that but don't underestimate its abilities off-road, it is very impressive. And the interior, oh my the interior. Wow, wow, wow. Gorgeous. Quality. Comfort. Perfection. The exterior? Well I like it. I don't love it like the 911 exterior, or a Ferrari. But it is different and there is something about this car that makes you take notice. I think it's cool, if a bit quirky. As I said, you really have to live with this vehicle to realize how great it is. One pleasant surprise has been our MPG with the X6. We are averaging over 20MPG in mixed driving with lots of hills. Our old diesel Mercedes GL averaged 20 and we thought that was great. 20MPG for this sporty, gas vehicle is super impressive and I have heard of people getting over 30 MPG on the highway. So if you are looking for a versatile vehicle that drives fantastic and provides a lot of utility while being stylish and different check out the X6.",
  "bmw_x6_2016": " Have owned 3 X5's, a 5 series and a 3 series over the years and have always wanted an X6. When I saw the new design I had to have one. Ordered the dark olive directly from South Carolina. Only took 3 weeks to get it after ordered. Love everything about it! Now, if you have kids and you need more space for traveling etc. then this isn't for you. I drive the car primarily and my wife and I have already taken trips. It's the perfect fun vehicle for a middle aged empty nester like me.",

So what are your explanation for it coming off the tracks! There also spots in the paint that look like water spots that do not come off! Very disappointed! Wished I had never traded my Cadilac in for this Casscada! And yes , it a year old with 5,000 miles!",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " I understood the Cascada was an Opel, introduced about 3yr ago. As such, I realized that the electronics and safety features would not match my wife's 2016 Subaru Outback with the eyesight pkg., an outstanding and versatile wagon.                                                 What the Cascada does is it makes me smile. Style, great. Handling, the HiPer Strut up front and Watt Z link rear suspension makes a taunt but comfortable ride. The top goes up and down quickly and at a reasonable speed. Economy, town about 20 mpg hwy - filled up in Dallas, two stops, cruse control @ 70, and arrived in Conway Ar. with 33mpg. Very happy. Seats, adequate. Nav., again probably 3 yrs old. Nice touches, rain sensing wipers, and heated steering wheel. The car is quiet for a convertable, and the sound system is great.

Looking in the rearview and passenger blind side is tough but no worse than the Dodge Challenger I traded in.  Best features are the front visibility and ease of putting on and taking off the roof.  It also has a quieter ride than expected.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " At least a beauty of a car for a middle-class hardworking person that wants a comfortable and can't afford a Mercedes or other high end vehicle.   I am in love with my car.  The look, the ride, the comfort, the pick up, everything.   The only thing is being it in the 2016 and it being almost winter I was hoping I would get a better price but afraid not.  I am still paying over 450 a month on a lease after putting over 3000 down for 36 months and I think that crazy, but it's what I wanted to drive so I did it.  I hope to maybe buy it out, we'll see.  Anyhow.  compared to the BMW bug it was roomier, a more luxury car and BMW  payments would have been the same, so I went with the Buick and  got the car I  really wanted and the Cascada is a real gem.",

  "buick_cascada_2016": " In Pittsburgh the convertible market is not a booming market, so the selection of exterior, interior colors and wheel types were very limited. I ordered our Buick Cascada in the beginning of March, and received it at the end of May (three months delivery time). I enjoy driving the car more and more each day. It is quite and the ride is smooth on good roads, a bit bumpy on uneven roads (sport suspension). Our roads are hilly and windy here in Pittsburgh, but the Cascada handles the road exceptionally well. Seat and steering wheel adjustments are very accommodating. Initially I was concerned about the rear view visibility and the enclosed feeling with the roof up, but have no problems. The curvature of the two side mirrors is such that half of the lane behind me is visible in each of the side mirrors. Although the rear window is small, and is at an angle that reduce the visibility even more, between the rearwiew mirror and the two side mirrors visibility is pretty good. I have always had cars with sun roofs or panoramic roofs, so I was not sure how a solid black roof over my head will feel. I guess because of the huge wind shield and all the surrounding glass, there is absolutely no enclosed feeling. The trunk is small with the roof down, but that was expected with a convertible. It is a good size with the roof up except for the trunk opening. I am not a golfer, but I do not think that a golf bag would fit through the opening of course there is always the back seat. In other reviews there have been a lot of comments about outdated dash, and too many buttons. True, there are a lot of buttons, but most of them are duplicates of the touch screen buttons.  Just have to get used to when to use which button, touch screen or dash. I particularly like the ",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " This car is basically great for a baby boomer like me that wants a comfortable, safe convertible cruiser, but it needs a few additions after driving it.  Even if they are stand alone options this needs blind spot/cross traffic monitoring, and adding automatic emergency braking to its forward collision warning. I would gladly pay 2 to 3 thousand greenbacks more for these options.  They already have part of this on the Verano.  I will be replacing my Mustang convertible with another one, loaded with all the tech (including adaptive cruise control) available now.  If more is added in the next two or three years to the Mustang or even the Cascada (I don't need a fast sports car) I will trade.  Smart folks my age want the driver assist tech, because as Clint Eastwood put it so well, ",

  "buick_cascada_2016": " Went to learn about cascada and test drive at Buick near me. Showroom car looked beautiful in and out. I wanted to see the trunk but it couldnn't be opened by anyone in the dealership. Trunk has no keyhole (does not use a key to open)  or open lever or switch  inside the car, the only way to open is to press a plate on trunk hood. Problem, is that the battery was dead and that wouldn't work!  Disappointed the driver seat has no memory! More consideration for back seat passenger as seat stops if knees are hit. Problem is that I don't ever have passengers in the back seat. Fake alarm system above front windshield. Was told 2017 will bring an alarm sensor for when the top is down. Liked that however Started think I should wait for next model. Hands free microphone worked ok with top down. Radio speaker quality is very poor. Top went up and down amazingly. Not having to use latches to lock the top is a great feature. Premium accessories include a windbreaker that has to be manually attached each time to avoid draft on driver/ front passenger bak and same for back seat.  Didn't like the sound of that.

  "buick_cascada_2016": " To date, the 2016 Cascada with 5148 miles, has been in the dealership service lane 5 times, all for the same reason.   The convertible top is faulty.   I initially took the car in due to a very odd knocking and popping sound coming from the rear of the vehicle.  My first dealership said it was road noise and I had to deal with it.  This was literally metal on metal banging...    After I insisted the dealer attempt to diagnose the noise concern, a technician somehow broke the interior panel but didnt tell me, nor replace the actual part.  I then received a message once again stating the knocking was just road noise and body-flex and couldnt be fixed.    After contacting Buick, I was connected to another dealership which took the time to review the knocking and found the broken panel, and also a screw that wasnt seated properly.   Drove home in complete quiet.  Three days later...The knocking was back and this time I had a leak on the opposite side of the car.   Back to the dealer...    They adjusted the top and replaced the seal as the dealer stated the seal had managed to fold incorrectly and formed to that shape and had to be replaced.   Further adjustments to the top and the knocking was gone again.  A week later...The banging and knocking is back.  The interior panel that was replaced has again disconnected and is flapping around constantly.   Adjusted, reseated, no more knocking.   A week later...banging is back again.    Returned to the dealer and had a technician drive the car.   After a day in the shop the technician decided to replace a guide pin for the top cover.   Noise gone again.   3 days later...    Knocking and clacking is back, I have a leak, and the chrome trim was gouged by the service team during the last service.   Being returned to the dealer.  At this point, the 2016 Buick Cascada has become the biggest let down / regret of my car purchasing life.   Though the service team has been polite and helpful, I didnt buy the vehicle for it to be in service more than I am able to drive it.    Definitely regret the whole purchase at this point.UPDATE:    12/14/2016     GM and I reached an agreement that included a buy-back of the Cascada.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " Bought this car for my wife (she loves it), and to be fair we have not had it but for a few weeks. I was looking for the great American convertible, something like a 1960s Buick LeSabre or Pontiac Catalina, but alas the big, roomy American verts are long gone. I was going to get a 2 series BMW (tiny back seat) or a CPO E350 (same price, 4 years old) convertible, but I went to see this car, too. Glad I did.This car has a comfortable, adult-sized back seat, big trunk for a vert, drives well, has wonderful front seats, and looks great (blue with the cream interior). It feels solid. Despite some of the pundits' reviews, the car feels plenty quick if not sports car quick (this car is not a sports car but a cruiser, which is what I wanted). The top works like a dream and the car is very quiet with the top up. Bose stereo is solid. The few negatives are no memory driver's seat the low profile 20 inch tires can be jarring on rough pavement rearward view with the top up is poor and it is not really an American car, despite the nameplate. Some others have complained about the gadgets in the car like nav and lane change assist, but I have an I-phone for nav (although the Buick's nav works okay) and I can drive without some electronic nanny steering my car. As far as they go, these gadgets work okay, but I do not need them or want them on this or any other car. If you want a relatively affordable convertible that looks great and makes you smile, this could be your car.Update: Have had the car for about six months and we have loved every minute of it. Great car.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " Our new Deep Sky Blue Cascada replaces our faithful old Chrysler Sebring JXI.  My wife loves convertibles and this car is a nice one.  So far she has logged just a few hundred miles but they have been surprisingly enjoyable.  The turbo 4 has better then expected performance and the handling is crisp.  Not a floaty ride like Buick's of yore.  Much has been made of all of the buttons on the dash, but most are only used occassionally and you quickly get used to the layout.  The seats are comfortable and the convertible top, and it's mechanism, are awesome.  So far we haven't found  much not to like about this car.  Styling is extremely attractive from every angle and the car gets a lot of compliments.  At $37K, the price seems reasonable for what you get.  Our old Sebring listed at $27k when new back in 2000, and it is no where near as well equipped.  The car has some nice Euorpean touches, like the redundant set of tail lights when the trunk is open and the side signal lights on the front fenders. As for fuel economy, we recently averaged 28.6 mpg on a day trip here the DIC showed an average speed of 46 mph city/highway.  We are looking forward to enjoyable summer driving with this car.Update:  November, 2016 -  Enjoyable summer with the Cascada.  Fun car to drive.  Current mileage is around 3,000 with no problems encountered.  Still getting a lot of positive comments.",

The seats are phenomenally comfortable and well bolstered.  I find the controls are in easy reach.  The car is so quiet I can't hear it running.  The acceleration is smooth and energetic. The sound system is great.  The built-in wifi is a very nice.I honestly couldn't be happier with the car.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " We wanted a convertible, I wanted something fun to drive with style. I owned a Lotus Elise, but that was too small as we aged, so we were looking for something a little bit more. We looked at the Audi A3, but if it had the features of this (German company Opel) car, it cost $12K more. I didn't buy it to turn heads, but to be honest, it gets a significant amount of attention. Maybe not like the Lotus did, but it's a very good looking car. It's not fast, but it handles well, I love the front end suspension that handles the vagaries of the road and stops the odd bump from pulling the steering. Very nice feature. Overall this is a great touring car with an amazingly quiet interior even with the top and windows down. It's also got super spousal support, a moderate price, and solid overall performance. Take a look, I promise you won't be disappointed...IF you are willing to keep an open mind and realize a Buick can be pretty cool.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " Visibility is very poor. Front window view is blocked by sensing equipment. Rear window visibility is about 2 feet by 10 inches. Forward collision alert is useless. It doesn't do anything? It should be stopping you, but doesn't. If I had to rely on the alert, I would have hit the object by the time I heard the alert. Same thing with Lane Departure Warning. It beeps if you drift into another lane? What is it's purpose? If there is a car then you've already hit it. I think Forward Collision and Lane Departure Alerts are a waste of money. Autonomous Cruise Control and Blind spot alert would have been a better option. There are no widow locks like there is on my Chrysler and the top down and window express down are on the console. My dogs are constantly rolling down my windows. There is very little storage space in the car. I thought my Chrysler Convertible was bad, this has 1/2 the storage. The engine has more power than I thought there would be. The turbo and 6 speed gives it plenty of pick up. I'm not impressed with the navigation system. The 6 year old technology on my Chrysler runs circles around the Buick. Voice recognition is useless with the top down. Love the Rainsense, Auto on/off headlamp control, and the climate control. Never have to touch them. Backseat pass through is great. Backseats are useless. Would have been better to make the car a 2 seater and add more storage space to the trunk.Car handles extremely well, reminds me of my Corvette. Nice car, I like it, but way over priced! I own 2 convertibles and my Chrysler is a lot more car for about $11,000 less. If your buying American, forget it. The transmission is made in Mexico, engine is made in Hungary, car is built in Poland and distributed from Germany. Its an Opel with Buick emblems. The car is a Vauxhall Cascada in the UK, a Holden Cascada in Australia, an Opel  Cabrio in Spain, an Opel Cascada in the rest of Europe and a Buick Cascada in the U.S. and China. Same car different emblems. Overall I like it, but it needs some improvements as mentioned above.UPDATE:I have now had the car for several months. Tried to put the top down using the key fob as stated in the manual and as instructed by the dealer. Windows retracted, but stopped at that point and the top wouldn't go down. I took it to the dealer and they worked on it for about 2 hours. They called the manufacturer when they couldn't figure out the problem. Long story short, GM decided to not install the software until the 2017 Cascada (it is on the Canadian version). Called and complained to GM, but even though the dealer thought the software was there and the manual states it's there. GM won't fix the problem. I thought GM emerged from bankruptcy as a new and improved company. Not so, same old crappy customer service, last GM I will own.",
  "buick_cascada_2016": " Had the Cascada for a month now and it is a joy to drive.  It has a classy design and great leather interior that is extremely well designed.  We recently went on first road trip of 1100 miles and it was great.  We encountered strong winds in New Mexico and the Cascada went straight as an arrow while other vehicles were all over the place.  We held the speed at 80 MPH and got 26 MPG which is actually pretty good considering all the headwinds.   Cascada allows the user to get extra room in the truck if the top is up by merely pressing forward the device that holds the top in the trunk.  We had lots of room for a very large suitcase and three other carry on type bags(also could easily hold a set of golf clubs in this mode).  The sound systems is top of the class and can be easily heard because the road noise is kept at a minimum on the Cascada(yes even at 80 MPH).",

  "buick_enclave_2016": " I've owned two Dodge Durangos (first a 2012 V6 model, now a 2015 RT Hemi) and found myself spending a week with the Enclave during a work trip. High points of the Enclave are generously sized cargo and seating areas, smooth freeway sailing, and overall comfort. The cargo area seems to be quite a bit larger than my Durango.  However once you get off the interstate and onto the twisties, the Enclave shows it's weak spots. In my rental with 20,000 miles, the transmission hunts for gears, is slow to respond, and can be clunky as it tries to keep up. Switching to low for engine braking on steep downgrades is not terribly effective in this vehicle, nor is it smooth. Low speed cornering is controlled and predictable, but at moderate or greater speeds there is quite a bit of body roll. Getting into technology - the audio system (this one did not have Nav) was not intuitive. I'm sure you get used to it as you own it, but the system of menus and sub menus seemed oddly organized. Dodge/Chrysler is miles ahead with the UConnect system, and I would also rate this well behind the system in Toyotas that I have rented. THe interior material quality also is not what I expect for the price range. Granted, rentals do get abused, but the high gloss console surfaces appear to be easily scratched, and the dull black plastic center stacks look cheap. Lastly, there were a number of odd noises that I would not expect from a new vehicle with this mileage. Creaks and groans from the suspension were noticeable over the rough roads of New Jersey. To anyone considering one of these, I urge you to check out the competition closely, especially the Durango (I feel that the Durango handling is worlds beyond the Buick, and with the V8, so is the power). You can do better than the Enclave for the money.",
  "buick_enclave_2016": " I test drove every 7 seated SUV and really found a couple that I would purchase. I like how the Dodge Durango and Honda Polite drove. I had basically narrowed my choice to those two SUV until I test drove this SUV. This one blew the other two away on how it hugged the road and how quiet it was.  The spacious room in the back and the ease of getting in and out of the second and third row was a selling point as well.  The interior did not have all the bells and whistles that the other two had but the comfort and safety I felt in this SUV made my decision easy.....I highly recommend this SUV above all. Update:   I have had this SUV since August and have nothing but great things to say about the vehicle. It rides great and is very reliable. I wish it has gotten better mileage but it gets about 18 mpg.  I have not been to happy with the On star and Free Radio both are expensive once the three months free trial is over.

Good vehicle for us as we haul grand kids around and three car sets with 4 grand kids is not a problem.  The entertainment system is great when traveling any distance with them as they can watch DVD's and not bother us in the front seat.  Only hang up I have ever had is getting at the spare tire.

The only complaint so far with the electronics is the navigation system.  It doesn't understand my southern dialect.  Half the time I have to manually key in destinations as opposed to speaking them.  I hope that time will enable the system to learn my voice.  Creature comforts are impeccable.  Seats are a little stiff compared to my Town Car but I expect them to loosen up over time.  Leg room is the best out there, bar none, particularly the second row seating.  Even the third row seating is adequate for relatively short trips.  Noise levels are on a par with most luxury cars, quiet.  Power is adequate for a vehicle this size but will not snap any necks.

Turbo chargers do not favorably impress me.  Just something else to go wrong.  I finally took one for a test drive.  Did not seem to be as spunky as my 2.0L 2000 Tracker but maybe I could get used to it.  The Tracker is 17 years old now.  I bought it new in November of 1999.  I really do need a new vehicle now.  Sadly, I had to walk away from the Encore because of the dark tinted glass.  I am older now, don't see as well as when I was young.  Always have had some trouble seeing at night.  It gets worse when you get older.  You will understand that later.  Tinted glass is a real pain for me.   I don't care if people can see in.  I need to be able to see out, in every direction, front, back, and sides.  That is what is important and the Encore fails in that respect.  The Encore does not seem to be available without the dark tinted glass in the back.  That seems to be the case with most of the new SUVs.  Even the front glass is a bit dark for me.  I guess I am going to have to keep on driving my 1994 and 2000 4WD Trackers.  They go in the deep snow and on the ice.   And they can pull your boat and trailer out of the water at the lake shore.  The Encore can't even pull a small trailer.  And they call it a SUV.  I don't  know that AWD would be as good.  My Trackers do have very light tinted glass.  Don't even need that but it is tolerable.  Clear glass would be better.  I know the dark tinted glass is only in the rear but it reduces the available light throughout the interior of the vehicle.  I really need a new car but I can't find anything acceptable to me.  Everything has dark tinted glass and they all seem to have way too many buttons on the dash.  I can't drive and read the operator's manual at the same time.  I don't text and drive.  I like to be able to find the controls by touch.  I don't want to have to look for them.  I have to keep my mind on the road.  I don't want distractions.  This is all insane.  Aftermarket tint is readily available for all car windows.  Why do the automobile manufacturers have to force tinted glass on all of us?  It definitely is a serious safety hazard.",
  "buick_encore_2016": " Recently purchased this vehicle.  Traded in a Honda. Was looking for something that was relatively fun, stylish, and comfortable.  The Encore fits the bill perfectly.  Some people have mentioned the power as a negative.  I find it to be more than acceptable.  Have not experienced a problems with it.  The inside is made up of generally high quality materials.  The vehicle is extremely quiet under all circumstances. I highly recommend it.  Before buying, I test drove the following.  Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, and Jeep Renegade.  After doing that, it was very easy to buy the Encore.",
  "buick_encore_2016": " What a great car and value. We test drove both the Honda CRV , Toyota Rav4, both were great cars, but the difference we fond was the ride quality, craftsmanship and overall bang for your dollar. This is our second Buick, and what we are seeing with the Buick is reliability and overall satisfaction level for what you get for your total all in cost. For 20 years all we have bought is Japanese cars, because of the reliability and safety. I have no problem tell other consumers that Buick has done a great job to earn our business back to American made cars.",

The only complaint I have read or seen others talk about is the engine power, well unless you are trying to be a NASCAR RACER! I think the encore has more than enough power! Now I would not recommend this for some one who plans on carrying around more than 4 people at a time but this is fine for 2 adults and 2 children. One feature I like is that rear , front seats close completely flat! I did have to get used to the auto stop fuel saving feature which shuts off the motor when stopped .  but overall I highly recommend this to someone looking for a small suv !",

  "buick_encore_2016": " The only thing keeping me from rating the very first and only service experience at Williamson Buick in Miami 'a perfect 10' is the fact that although the service advisor (Ivan Pellegrino) told me they had been able to duplicate exactly what I had brough the car in for (what I called 'a hesitation from a full stop on Drive'), and had verified the same thing in other Encores, therefore concluding it was 'normal' for the design of its powertrain, the documentation I received simply says 'no trouble found'.  This concerns me, for it would indicate there is no feedback to the factory that there is a potential performance issue with the current Encore design, not to mentio the fact that if this symptom gets worse with time, there is no reference as to the fact that it was exhibited when brand new.",
  "buick_encore_2016": " I read quite a few reviews that suggested that the Encore is a bit sluggish. Though I would not take it out on the autobahn, we were very happy with the Sport Touring trim (new for 2016) that has a slightly more powerful engine and AWD. During the test drive, I practically demanded that we take the car out on the freeway and drove several miles out of the way to do so. I'm so glad I did as acceleration was more than sufficient to deal with traffic on I-95 near Philadelphia (if you know the area, you will know that is no small feat). Remember, this is a compact SUV - you don't need a 6- or 8- cylinder engine to pull this weight. In terms of interior comfort and size, I am more than impressed. There are plenty of storage options, totally flat-folding seats, and a 60/40 split bench seat that grants an extra amount of flexibility.

  "buick_encore_2016": " If your looking for a street racing car or a $100,000 car this is not for you. The Encore has made Buick take a step forward. I used to hate Buick until we looked at and drove the 2016 Encore. Unlike some who leave reviews I actually own it and have been driving it for several months. We have put 4 people in it and drove from Atlanta to Clearwater Fl and had no complaints. I have had a person about 6' 5",
  "buick_encore_2016": " The size/shape and features of this vehicle are great.  The price is right.  It's one of the few cars that might convince me to buy American again (it's been more than 20 years).  It's surprisingly well-featured, quite comfortable, and fairly agile.And then GM goes and put an absolutely anemic engine in it.  Zero-to-Sixty?  Maybe in 15 seconds with a tailwind -- which is going to cause problems getting on California's freeways and squirting in and out of traffic -- perhaps it's enough for states where they drive slower and more lawfully, but not here.  And this is on the increased-horsepower sport/touring model.  The base model is almost undriveable.I know that GM has better engines in its lineup.  There's no excuse for not having the option to put 200-250 horses under the hood (look at the VW Tiguan and BMW X1 to see this done well).  That change would make all the difference, and it's an absolute shame how much the current powerplants completely ruin the car.(I'm also one of the tiny minority of people who would prefer all cars to at least be available with a manual transmission... but for vehicles in this class, I know that will never happen)",
  "buick_encore_2016": " The seats are hard, the seating position is terrible, and you can't see out of it.. I have had the little SUV now for the past 3 days due to my Volt (which is a complete pile of garbage) being fixed again.. During that time i can say it is pretty good on gas, but the transmission is jerky, there is no snot at all in it, meaning it won't get out of it's own way.. the seats are too small, i am thin and tall, but the seats are way to short and too hard.. making it feel like you are sitting on a pick-nick bench.The audio controls require a degree in computer science to figure out, nothing is labeled well, the steering column plastic isn't straight, and there are noticeable creaks and rattles when you hit bumps.. (The Loaner has 395 Miles on it) There is NO storage at all in it, there are nooks and pockets to store things around the driver, but the rear of it where you would put groceries, or other shopping things, or even a baby stroller, there is simply just not enough room back there.  As per handling it may handle well, but it feels top heavy when you hit a corner which doesn't leave much confidence in the handling ability. Good: The BOSE stereo is amazing.. sounds fantastic.. The look of the materials makes it seem like a high end vehicle.. I mean until you realize, they are cheaply made.. Gas mileage seems pretty good for a small SUV (Very small)Bad: Fit and finishSeating position is hard short SeatsThe telescoping steering wheel is worthlessit rattlesYou can't see out  of it, and the parking sensors indicate you are too close at nearly 2ft from somethingIt's slow (The Volt feels like a corvette in comparison) It's expensive (There are a lot of MUCH better options for less)Due to it's shape you can't get anything in the hatch areaControls aren't well laid out..",
  "buick_encore_2016": " I've leased the electric blue base model of this car after test driving Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and Honda HRV. I wanted a compact car where I can sit slightly above the road and getting in and out would be easy on my lower back. I am a recent graduate and due to less credit history, most dealers rejected lease but the folks at Buick were great - they offered a 2-year lease at a decent price. The car is extremely comfortable and the driver seat comes with electronic adjustments and excellent lumbar support. I cannot find words to stress on how comfortable the driving experience is! It's interiors are great for a base model with leather accented seats, generously sized dashboard buttons and good leg room in rear seats. It also has OnStar care and satellite radio. It's modestly powered by a 1.4L turbo engine which does the job for a FWD. Major concerns about this car is external noise, horrendous bluetooth music playback(the rep told me that bluetooth is for voice only) and flat, muffled sounding speakers.Due to the external noise, i need to turn up the music volume and the speakers just sound bad (remember, this is a base model without the Bose active noise-cancellation setup). Music playback via AUX, radio and CD sound better. I didn't realize that the speakers were bad during the test drive but I've leased it for 2 years only. Overall, I highly recommend this car in the subcompact crossover segment if you're not too particular about brands or you don't mind a less sporty car. This car scores over all others for driving comfort which mattered the most. If you're thinking about leasing this for 2-3 years, i'd say it is a definite go, but get the higher end model with sunroof and bose speakers as it's so much more fun and exciting to step into your car!",
  "buick_encore_2016": " Take a good look at the cars that you have been admiring on the road and note that it is their body design that makes them appealing. The basic design of the Encore is overshadowed by a ton of unnecessary  glam. An overpowering front grill and a lot of randomly placed chrome has basically turned the car into a distasteful quinceanera dress. And don't even consider having a front seat passenger that weighs more that 150 pounds as they will not fit in the seat.Think long and hard before buying a car and then go and purchase one that you will get compliments on. The Buick Encore won't do that for you.",
  "buick_encore_2016": " The seats are made with EXTREMELY firm foam and are not designed for comfort.  The front passenger seat is smaller than the driver's seat.   It would be embarrassing to have a friend of a certain size not be comfortable in that seat   I could only drive about an hour without getting pain in my back. THEN I READ AN EDMUNDS REVIEW WHICH MENTIONED THAT AFTER DRIVING FOR AN HOUR IT BECAME AN UNCOMFORTABLE RIDE.The left side SAFETY ALERT is ineffective if a car is passing you at a fairly high rate  of speed.   By the time the left mirror lights up, the passing car is already beside you.   I suspect someone is going to rely on the system and wind up in a serious accident The dash is way too complicated.

  "buick_encore_2016": " I love Buicks because, if you get a premium model, you get all the extras including heated steering wheel and remote start which are add ons in other cars. I was intending to buy a Buick Regal, but was unhappy with the lack of visibility in my previous Buick sedan. The salesman suggested I test drive an Encore as well as the Regal. I loved the Encore! The visibility was much better, I enjoyed sitting higher up, and it was easier to park. Granted the trunk is rather small and there probably isn't much leg room in the back seat, but I rarely have a rear seat passenger, so that is fine. Also  important to me is that it has OnStar with Turn by Turn navigation and hands-free calling. This is a perfect vehicle for a retired lady who enjoys a certain amount of luxury in her car.Now that summer is here, I'm finding the air conditioning very comfortable and responsive. There is no cold air blowing on my hands. When I turn the temp higher or lower, I feel the difference immediately.I now have had my car 13 months. I do miss the large trunk I had in previous cars. I often end up putting things in the back seat because they do not fit in the trunk. Also I find that I hear quite a bit of road noise when driving. I often have to turn up the radio because of the road noise. When I drive through a puddle, there is a loud roaring sound. The first time I heard it I thought my tire was falling off or something. These are things I can live with and the overall good looks and easy handling of the vehicle balance them out.I did have one huge disappointment. A few months ago I drove over a pothole at the side of the road and ended up with a dented rim. In nearly sixty years of driving I have never before had a dented rim. Then I found out that, because rims these days are made of an aluminum alloy rather than steel, it could not be repaired. I ended up paying $500 to replace the wheel. This was not covered by the warranty. This failing of materials used in the wheels I cannot accept. This is wrong!",

The lease value was also a very convincing factor. The monthly  lease cost was similar to vehicles with an MSRP $10,000 less than the Envision. For the 2016 introduction in North America, only the Premium and Premium II trim is available. On next year's model, when the full line of trim options are available, I doubt this ",
  "buick_envision_2016": " I test drove the Acura RDX and Audi Q5 and chose the Premium I AWD 2.0T model of the Buick not only because it had way more technology and safety options for a comparable price but also because the drive, quality and interior design was much better.  This car has far exceeded my expectations and in my opinion is going to be a serious competitor in the luxury compact SUV market.  The turbo engine is powerful and fun to drive.  Loving the interior design and the technology is top notch.  The quality inside and out is also top of the line.  The lane departure assist and all the other safety features are way above the competition especially for the price point.  Buick continues to impress!! Definitely worth a test drive if in the market for a new compact SUV!",

  "buick_envision_2016": " We were trying to downsize from our GMC Acadia.  We've leased an Acadia for over 6 years and our youngest just left for college SO our full size SUV needs changed.   We were seriously considering a full size sedan ( Buick Lacrosse or Toyota Avalon) BUT our salesman encouraged us to just take a look at the Envision.  We wanted the moon roof and the navigation upgrade.  This has a great ride and is fun to drive.  It's true we have just taken possession but it fits everything we could ask for in a luxury SUV.",
  "buick_envision_2016": " We drove, and just ordered, a Premium II with the Driver Confidence package to get the Full-range Adaptive Cruise Control.  With the panoramic room, the 49k msrp may look steep.  But if you're shopping for a medium-sized luxury SUV/CUV, it's unbeatable for what you get.  We shopped for Suv/Cuv vehicles in its size range that met our requirements of having full-range acc, blis/cross-traffic, and ventilated or cooled seats.  That eliminated Audi , BMW because you can't get one equipped that way.  And ran a similarly equipped GLC300 up to over 55k.    Compared to the NX, GLC and Discovery Sport, we found:  Actually Cooled seats (also on the Discovery), rear seat climate controls, auto-dimming outside mirrors, rain sense wipers that can automatically turn on headlights (which is required in some states also on Discovery Sport), head-up display (also on NX, $995 on GLC, part of $1800 package on Discovery Sport), passive locking, tire monitor shows actual tire pressures, blind spot detection includes turn signal warning (also on GLC) and closing-vehicle detection (also on Discovery Sport).  Topped off with GM's safety alert seat so things like lane departure and parking sensors can rumble the seat instead of beeping.",
  "buick_envision_2016": " Believe the hype!",
  "buick_envision_2016": " Great luxurious crossover- The vehicle is priced appropriately when compared to other luxury crossovers. Do your homework you will see for yourself. I had test drove the Acura RDX prior to the Envision and found the RDX road height to be a bit low with a very hard ride, stiff sport suspension, not sure if that is ever needed in a crossover/small SUV. So I took a look at the Envision while looking at a Buick/GMC dealer. This Envision fits a void in the Buck SUV lineup. The Enclave is fairly large while the Encore is well yeah, kind of small. I was very impressed by the quiet smooth ride of the Envision along with the interior and exterior styling. On the interior the first thing i noticed was the all digital instrument panel, which makes it feel that much nicer. The interior trim is fitted with leather, i went with black since it is a lease and has a less chance of showing marks even though the beige is beautiful too. The dashboard is also covered in leather this is a nice touch over a plastic one most vehicles have. The front seats seem a little stiffer than i would expect but the heated leather wrapped steering wheel make up for this minor issue. Rear seating is comfortable with separate controlled ventilation for rear passengers. The rear seats can recline ever so slightly and have the ability to glide forward to make more room for cargo in the back. Interior lighting is very well placed with accent lighting on the floor and very eloquently placed lighting on the door panels and front face of dashboard. This looks very nice at night. Exterior lights look very nice with the daytime running LED's on the front and HID headlights and fog lights. Power lift gate is very convenient for loading and unloading. Now the real good part, the power that comes out of that little 4-cyl. is very impressive. I live in Colorado - high elevation and the vehicle has no problem with the thin air and  steep roads. The turbo on the 4-cyl works wonderfully. Lag is in the seconds, like 1-2 maybe. Collision avoidance and lane keeping assist work wonderfully as well. Hard to talk to the reliability right now but so far so good. Really the only downside (reason for not giving this 5 stars) is knowing it is being built in China. Hopefully Buick brings the assembly line for US sold vehicles to the US someday, I guess it is nice to know your employing Americans with your American brand vehicle.",
  "buick_envision_2016": " this car is proving itself to be a perfect, all around vehicle for me. I have owned the car for 5 months now and am very happy with my choice. but the warranty is great and have owned other Buicks with no problems. I love the way the dash is lower so that the visibility out front is outstandingly clear.  The car is very nimble and the steering is better than my previous Buick Enclave. Plenty of punch with this turbo engine, in fact it hardly acts as a four cylinder engine. The technology is greatly upgraded from my previous 2015 Enclave. Extremelythis size is right for us. The interior is of high quality material and well put together as you would expect of a Buick.  If I would find anything on the negative side, it would be the price. The price is too close to the larger Enclave and I expected it to be less, but the intro price was compensated to be fair.",
  "buick_envision_2017": " Coming from a 2013 and 2014 Cadillac, both of which I still have, the Buick is refreshingly solid and comforting in both riding and driving.  We got a used 2016 Premium ll with roof and Driver Confidence.  Plenty of head room with the roof in all seating positions.  The Adaptive Cruise Control along with the self parking feature and lane assist are really neat features. The parking is neat show off feature that this car is very easy to park and see out of.  The lane assist will have you bouncing off each side of the lane for miles, which is a little scary at first.  The ride quality is refined compared to the stiffer, performance oriented Cadillac.   The handling does not take a back seat to the softer suspension that this tracks and takes input better than a rental 2017 Escape.",

  "buick_lacrosse_2016": " Wife had issues with some blind spots - took getting used to. Very comfortable, responsive and handles great.",
  "buick_lacrosse_2016": " The rear window is extremely small resulting in large blind spots in the rear left and rear right of the car. The rear doors have smaller windows, which are fairly high in relation to a person sitting in the back. The cabin design, the side and position of the rear windows contribute to diminished visibility and nasty blind spots.The rear-view and the side view mirrors are incredibly small, also contributing to the limited visibility. The front driver seat, while being electronically adjustable, gives a driver the feeling like they are sitting on a moving platform. It is impossible to see the front end of the car no matter how high the front seat is positioned. The car has two control clusters, both in the form of a digital screens. The instrument cluster displays your speedometer and other options controlled by the steering wheel, while the second screen is in the center of the dash for the entertainment system. The left, up, right, and down directional buttons on the right side of the steering wheel navigate through menus displayed in the instrument cluster.  However, since there is no dedicated back button it is really confusing figuring out how to get out of them. The steering wheel has a very smooth feel which makes driving and parking effortless. The V6 engine seems fairly responsive and has a decent power output. However, It is paired with a transmission that sometimes gets confused in what gear it wants to shift. This is especially evident when flooring the gas pedal.",
  "buick_lacrosse_2016": " Tough choice between this AWD and Lincoln MKZ Reserve AWD but ended up with the Lincoln. Even the Buick Premium did not offer rear heated seats. The LaCrosse seemed a larger interior and more open feeling. I felt the MKZ  had a slightly smoother and more comfortable ride which was the tipping factor. Both nice cars. Considerrd es350, Impala, Cadenza and Azura.",
  "buick_lacrosse_2016": " This off-the-lot model did not come with the confidence package, which really should be standard due to visibility issues. My fault and I regret not ordering and waiting patiently. But the vehicle beckoned to me, and the killer price (Buick promotion 15% off, plus a bit more on this particular model as 2017s were rolling in) made me an easy mark. Very happy from the get-go with this car. Astonished by the value, and I love it more each day. I rent a great many cars on business and this one is more luxurious than any of them. The quiet is so effective it's almost offputting. Near silence even at 50 mph, and then only the pleasant hum of the tires. Handles beautifully. There is but one drawback: Tye poor visibility I mentioned. Thick posts obscure forward view at 10 am and 2 pm, rear view no treat either, and blind-spot is wretched. That's why I miss the driver confidence package, which dealer says cannot be retrofitted. Sure wish I had the head-up display, too (!) But adding up the other pluses: Heated seats rock, interior lighting is legant, the surfeit of USB ports wonderful. Love the remote car starting, memory seats and even trunk storage, which though somewhat cramped, turns into bat cave by lowering of back seats. Love the push-button parking break. The V-6 engine is plenty beefy for any circumstance, When I need to pass I tickle the gas pedal and--whom!--I'm gone. Buick nailed so many details with this model. Headrests are perfect...seats hug you like firm glove nice balance between cushiness and support...unlocking of door with push of a button is a minor miracle, and entire layout of controls is very sensible. I'm a fan, and wish there were a way to add that pesky driver confidence package.",

  "buick_lacrosse_2016": " The Lacrosse was a potential candidate to be a retirement gift to myself in a year or two.  I decided to rent one for a week to take on a 1,000 mile trip.  It is now off my list.  The first shortcoming is the cramped driving position.  I'm 6 foot, 190 lbs and the position is much tighter than it has to be.  The console flares as it approaches the dash reducing valuable seating real estate.  My right leg was constantly fighting the console trying to get my foot squarely on the accelerator pedal.  The foot well size is reduced by the intrusion of the wheel well.  The seat went back far enough, a big plus.  The dash seems to be close to the seating position and it curves as it approaches the door.  I hit it the corner twice during exiting.  Then there is the road noise.  It is unacceptable for a car of this supposed caliber.  The noise is intrusive starting about 35 mph on anything but smooth asphalt.  At highway speeds, it is a constant nuisance.  Thankfully, the wind noise is minimal, as it should be.  Handling was very excellent and the ride was OK, nothing worth noting.  Brakes, OK.   The climate control worked very well and the controls were easy to understand.  The entertainment system was another weak area.  The screen was a nice size, but distracting because of the scarcity of buttons on the dash.  The screen is tilted and so is the bezel which made is difficult to push the smallish station preset icons.  Everything has to be done via the two knobs and a couple of buttons or the touch screen.  Either way, it causes the driver to divert their attention from the road.  The sound was excellent and it was not the premium radio.  The powertrain (V6) was excellent, as was the gas mileage.  I averaged just over 30 mpg (calculated) for highway (mostly), suburban and in-town driving.  The trunk was nice and big and the fit and finish were excellent.    By contrast, I'm leasing a 2015 Verano which is superior in several areas.  It does not exhibit as high a level of road noise as the Lacrosse and the entertainment system is easier to use because it has buttons for things like the radio presets.  The driver's position is not as cramped, even though it is slightly smaller overall and the pedal feel of the brakes is better.  However, it is smaller and does not have the same ride comfort as the Lacrosse which runs 10-20k more.  Maybe the redesign will improve many of these deficiencies which would put the Lacrosse back on my list.",

  "buick_lacrosse_2017": " This car has an engine auto stop program in it that shuts off the engine at every stop to save gas.  The transmission jerks when it shuts off and starts up.  It feels like someone just ran into the rear of the car when it starts up.  This program will not let you come to a smooth stop before the engine stops.  Then after the engine stops and it needs to start up again to operate the air conditioning, the car jumps ahead when the engine starts up again.  Impossible to creep forward slowly.  It is very annoying, aggravating and uncomfortable feeling.  There is no way one can shut off this auto stop program.  If I knew that this was going to happen, I would not have bought this car.  Everything else in or on the car is great.",
  "buick_lacrosse_2017": " I had turned in my 2015 Impala and was looking for another sedan. I had driven the Chrysler 300 and the Lexus ES 350. My local Buick dealer let me take the Lacrosse  for the weekend to give it a thorough test drive. While the car has many positive attributes, there are few major issues that kept me from buying it. First the good: The engine and transmission are a dream and provide smooth, quick, fuel efficient operation. The engine has strong exceleration and utilizes cylinder deactivation on the highway. I  achieved an incredible 31 mpg highway which is very good for this size of car. The 8 speed transmission is the best I have ever driven and unlike other 8 speeds, it doesn't hunt back and forth for the right gear. It shifts so imperceptibly, there were many times I had no idea what gear I was in. Very Nice! Lastly, you can order Adaptive Cruise with an 18",

  "buick_lacrosse_2017": " Being retired, I was looking for a quite comfortable roomy car with easy to use controls and lots of safety features for my wife and me to use for travel.  The Lacrosse fit the bill. I was impressed with all the safety features (love the heads up display) and the ease of use of the entertainment and navigation systems.  Most luxury cars don't have touch screens, which to me was a distraction.  The simpler the better.  The trunk on the Lacrosse is huge so no problems getting luggage stowed.  On the road the Lacrosse is very quiet and comfortable with plenty of power when you need it.  I was impressed with the overall mileage on the first fill up at 29.4 mpg with a 200 mile trip to PA and the rest mixed driving.  Some things I found troubling was there was no sunglass holder in the overhead (can use the space under the shifter, but still...), the visibility is not as good as I would have liked out the front when making turns and parking, and the transmission hunts a bit at low speed going up twisty hills.  People complain about the electronic shifter, but I found it easy to use once I got used to it. Overall I find the Lacrosse to fit my needs just fine and look forward to many miles of comfortable quite travel.",

My wife and I wanted a lighter color outside with a light color interior also.  We bought it in July 2016 when Buick was giving 20% off on certain  models.  We used our GM points from our GM card and the discount on the car listed for 31,000 we paid $23,300 for it. I could not pass up that deal up. The color was   Champagne Silver with cashmere  leather interior. I love the changes  ,  improvements they have made since 2011.  My 2016 drives smoother and is quieter , the turbo engine is great. It is real easy to use all of the features this car has to offer. I can get in this car , drive it on a long trip , feel comfortable the whole time. This is only one the second Buick I have owened. I have been driving  since 1972 , have owened a lot of cars , trucks over the years both foreign , domestic.  We have 5 vehicles  now , the Buick is  by far my favorite to drive.  I have test driven other mid sized sedans  but I like the Regal best.",

After leasing Hondas and Toyotas for the past 15 years without a hint of a problem,in less than 1500 miles--THE TRANSMISSION BLEW!  Now I don't want the repaired car- at79 years old I don't need the hassle of another problem sometime in the next 3 years of the lease.But of course Buick and the dealer make you sweat blood to get a new one, so I guess I'm stuck,AVOID MY MISTAKE! Stick with the Japanese cars!",
  "buick_verano_2016": " The acceleration is less than exciting. The luxury feel is great, a very comfortable ride. The rear window is small and there are some blind spots when it comes to vision. A beauty of a car, still trying to get used to the extra shifting of the 6-speed transmission which sometimes feels a little jerky when trying to set cruise control for a speed that is in between gears. Overall I am very happy with this car, I just wish I had the turbo engine on the sport touring model.",
  "buick_verano_2016": " I went from a 2014 GMC SUV to the Buick Verano.  I wasn't even interested in looking at a Buick when my dealership asked me if I was interested in Buick.  They took me out to the Verano and I was impressed with the way that the exterior looked.  I have to say that it is a sleek looking vehicle and it looks like a luxury sedan, without the luxury price.  I then sat inside, and I have to say my first thought was WOW, Buick did a really good job.  Now after driving it for a month, I have to say that the ride is pleasurable, it's quiet, the entertainment features are great, and the car is a joy to drive.  It's considered a compact car however I feel like I'm driving in a full size sedan.  I just don't feel like the car is that small.  The interior design and layout is of great comfort and looks very classy.  Everyone that has been inside my car says, wow this is nice.  Buick really did a great job making this sedan look like a luxury vehicle.  My girlfriend jokes with me that I bought a luxury vehicle.  The car handles well and I do a lot of city driving and with the help of cruise control when I can use it, I'm getting 27 miles to the gallon in the city.  So you can stretch the MPG if you drive sensibly.  Overall I have to say that I am happy to be in this vehicle.  It certainly feels different than driving an SUV, but I was ready for a switch and am enjoying Buicks Verano.",
  "buick_verano_2016": " Love the power of the turbo engine. Fuel economy if fair but a great tradeoff due to the tractability of the engine. No turbo lag. I'm okay with the quality of the trim, actually it's better than I thought it would be. Nice feature is the backup camera. The yellow lines follow the arc of the car as it travels in reverse. Have all of the driving aids and they work real well, easy to use. The navigation and touch screen work quite well. Like the use of the voice commands. Have the Onstar security package. Car looks like its carved out of a single piece. Great quality. Steering is communicative, brakes feel soft at first but have no problem with them. Rear seat leg room is tight if the front seats are all of the way back. Under normal conditions, they're okay for us. Again, nice car. Would highly recommend to others. Was looking at the Buick Encore, but would have to order it to get exactly what I wanted (I did this for the Verano), but it would take 5 to 6 months to get. It's made in S. Korea and after looking at the Verano, it was actually a better choice for us. And the Verano 2016 is made in Michigan and the engine in Tenn. That was a consideration for us as well.",
  "buick_verano_2016": " The Verano is based off the same GM platform as the Chevy Cruze Limited, yet it feels like a completely different car. Driving it you feel greater power right off the bat. No, it's not sports-car-Camaro power, but I disagree with the Edmunds review that acceleration's merely adequate. The Verano feels more powerful than either the Cruze Limited or the new Cruze for 2016, possibly because the entire car feel much more solid, thus dissipating less energy in parasitic vibrations. The Verano gives you a sure, solid feeling on the road. An important contributor toward that end is the stark difference in streering and handling between any of the Cruze models and the Verano. The short of it is that the Cruze - particularly the newly redesigned 2016 Cruze - feels incredibly insecure and unstable during fast accelaration or highway speeds, while the Verano is almost the opposite of that. It's steering and handling feel stable and secure, with only a mere trace of lost of control to clue you into the fact that it's built with electronic - rather than traditional mechanical - steering. To take the point further, compared to any of the [now many] Cruzes, the Verano is rock solid. With the handling nicely under control, the suspension provides and excellent combination of road feel balanced against absorbtive comformt. In other words, it handles beautifully, without turning you into scrambled eggs while doing so. The interior is, as you'd expect, at or near luxury car levels. It's quiet and plush. Some might object to the two-tone white-on-black color scheme [Buick calls the interior grey - but it's pretty much white], but that seems to be the thing with luxury cars. The designers of the Verano did, however, make one major mistake. The steering wheel blocks your view of the instrument gauge cluster. No matter how far you tilt it up or down, you're just not going to see the speedometer, nor much else of your guages. Having taken such apparent care with the design of the car, how'd they screw that up? Good luck with speed cops on the road.A more minor issue's one of personal taste. I found the front grill to be almost aggresively tasteless, with Buick taking its vertical design a bit too far. The grill extends upwards and folds into the hood, and it's made of plastic. So, you get a lot of plastic grill in your face everytime you approach your car. Overall, I thought the Verano was very nice small vehicle, that - at least as far as driving impressions go - leaves it's stablemate Cruze well behind and makes the Corolla and the 2016 Civic almost non-competative [especially the almost shockingly crude, cheap-feeling, and sounding Corolla]. The other question is, of course, reliability, and it's only on that measure that the latter two may [or may not - who knows?] have an edge.",

Car has styling, performance and handling.  Most noticeable is the ride quality over the XTS which was not bad but the CT6 gets a 10 out of 10 for ride quality.  It handles like a much smaller sports car yet it bathes you in luxury.  My only complaint is the lack of storage compartments for the driver.  The auto stop/start takes some getting use to but the on/off switch allows you to turn the system off if desired.  I looked at the 750 BMW and a S550 Mercedes before choosing to stay with the Cadillac CT6. The lack of performance and handling with earlier big Caddy's drove me to BMW for a spell.

  "cadillac_ct6_2017": " After test driving a few of the 2017 CT6 models, I have concluded this is not the perfect car for me at this time.  First of all, like many high end luxury vehicles, this car is air tight.  Therefore, when all the windows are up, it is difficult to get the doors to close without slamming them.  That's the reason why many of it's competitors went with automatic soft closures for the doors, like the trunk.  Next, a rear wheel drive is not available with the 3.6L engine.  Though I live in the snow belt next to one of the Great Lakes, I have never found the need for AWD as long as I use the right winter tires.  I love the way rear wheel handles.  I will never own FWD again, but would do an AWD as long as primary power comes from the rear.  And, I won't be sold on a turbo charged 4 cylinder engine forced to work hard to act like a 6 or an 8.  Besides, now you are stuck using premium fuel.  Next, I dislike steering wheel paddle shifter's and want to do my manual shifting on the stick in the center console.  And, I was hoping to be able to select something other than black for the dashboard and trim without having to move into the Platinum model.  What with the rear camera mirror?  It actually made me nauseous looking at it.  Otherwise, it is a very good looking vehicle and would most likely own one if it at least had the door closures.  I'm not going to slam doors on my vehicles.  I liked many of the features like heads up display, start/stop technology and brake hold.

I am disappointed in the autostop performance. When it does activate (when is hard to predict) the engine has an annoying shudder when it stops as well as restarts. I have driven other GM models that are much better. The transmission shifts very well and doesn't seem to have a problem managing 8 gears. Although I like the hard inside cover for the sunroof, the roof itself does not seem to open as far as the previous version and it looks a bit clunky from the outside when open. The Cue system is much faster than before I have no problem with the controls at all. I did expect the Navigation system to have a more colorful display and I can't see how to name a route for future use. The gooseneck trunk hinges seem to be a step backwards from the articulated system of the Gen II model. The front seats are better than before but still not all that great for longer trips. Overall, I am very satisfied by this new CTS.",

  "cadillac_cts_2016": " The Auto Stop/Start is terrible.  It may not bother everyone (I cannot fathom how people don't mind this), but it is annoying and distracting every time you stop the car.  The car shakes and jiggles at every stop sign and stop light.  My passengers are incredulous when they're first taken for a spin.  It is not only annoying, but also distracting.  Your mind goes to it every single time you stop.  You can turn this off every time you start the car, but it is not possible to turn this feature off permanently.Almost all the 2016 Caddys have Auto Stop/Start (I think the XTS is the only one that doesn't) and they take the fun and relaxation out of driving.  Make sure you thoroughly test drive them before buying.  When test driving, make sure you do some city/urban driving and turn the A/C off (it doesn't kick in when the A/C is chugging at a decent rate).  Like I said, it won't bother everyone, but will bother many.  Enough so that GM put out a couple bulletins on the subject.  These are for the ATS and CTS, but I would think it applies to all 2016s with Auto Stop/Start.  Check out #15-NA-033 xe2x80x9cNormal Characteristic xe2x80x93 Slight Bump, Jerk or Rough Engine Startup [Oct 15, 2015]xe2x80x9d.  It says xe2x80x9cCondition: some customers may comment that there is a slight bump, jerk or rough engine startup during an AutoStart eventxe2x80x9d.  Then it says, xe2x80x9cCorrection: This is a normal conditionxe2x80x9d.  I guess they said it was unusual, then had to correct it and say it is a normal condition!!!  Directive #16-NA-071: Diagnostic Tips for Stop/Start and Auto Stop Operation [Mar 4, 2016] says, xe2x80x9cCondition: Vehicle does not engage in Auto Stop mode and Vehicle automatically restarts during an AutoStop eventxe2x80x9d.  It goes on to say, xe2x80x9cIt is imperative that the customer be well informed about the unique features and operational characteristics of their vehicle equipped with Stop/Start.  For the sales team to be fully prepared, they should use the Getting to Know Your Vehicle guide as an outline when presenting the vehicle to the customerxe2x80x9d. Cadillac knows this is a terrible and they are not notifying their customers.Other cons: the run-flats are a poor ride they're loud and you can feel everything.  The 2016 CTS models don't come with a spare and instead have run-flats.  The tactile sliders/xe2x80x9dbuttonsxe2x80x9d are over-engineered.  Just give me a knob for the radio volume ditto for the A/C fan speed.  Also, a little more difficult to get out of than previous CTS.Pros:  trunk is larger than previous CTS nice and roomy.  The panel that comes up in the dash is a cool storage area (and lockable).  Cool feature that lets you program the radio so you are notified when your favorite band is on XM.  Bluetooth with phone is loud and clear.",
  "cadillac_cts_2016": " I received a 2016 CTS base model with 4 cyl as a loaner while my 2013 XTS Luxury is being serviced.  I love the XTS, the most comfortable car I've ever owned, ad thought about downsizing to the CTS Luxury as i like the exterior.   Appearance is great, the interior is basically the same look as my XTS however it is more cramped and the quality is a bit less, but being a downsize from the XTS i was not put off by that.  The ride is horrible!!  It's like driving an old pick up.  You feel every pebble, the engine noise is annoying.  The front seat is very comfortable though, I am 6 ft. so had the seat back almost all the way, making the backseat behind me useless.  Not a big issue for me, but thought i'd point it out.  The biggest problem with this car is the price.  They want more for a CTS and my XTS which is roomy, comfortable and rides like a cloud.",
  "cadillac_cts_2016": " Liking the car so far (1month now).  The fuel saving feature - where the engine cuts off at a stop - is a pain.  Glad there is an override feature.  The SUV does not have the override and that was at least one of the eliminating features for me to consider that vehicle.  Very nice acceleration.  Good gas mileage so far.",
  "cadillac_cts_2016": " Found the new Luxury Cadillac CTS 4 (all wheel drive) disappointing.  As usual still rides the same as 25 years ago.  Noise from tires, exhaust, engine come right through with the stereo set on low, requiring music to be turned up.  Lacks innovation, and technology, poor aero dynamics causing poor mileage.  Very heavy for no obvious reason except they're stuck in 90's.   Mercedes comes out with touch shift, GM will have to copy it.  Lexus are perfectly quiet on the inside, Cadillac has yet to copy.  Just seemed like a poor performance from all angles with little innovation.  I will go with Mercedes or Lexus over this manufacturers offerings.  Priced at 65,000 and told it rides like a Cadillac.  If you want poor quality still from a U.S automaker.  Test drive after driving a lexus or Mercedes and you to will be disappointed in a Cadillac just as I was.  Probably be another 15 years before I give them another chance with such poor planning and innovation.",

I commute 1000 a week and with using my level 2 charger overnight I average 54 miles per gallon. The stereo sounds amazing. The CUE system beats that of my Buick and my Yukon.The ElR. Is an impressive vehicle. The seats are simply the best in comfort of any vehicle I have owned. Although the lack lateral support, the comfort is a 10.  The ride is a good balance between sport and cruising. No issues besides a need to replace the intellibeam sensor.We also own a BMW i3 and GM's quality and implementation of hybrid technology is dramatically better. Great vehicle.",

I have owned a number of luxury cars over the years from Cadillacs to Lincolns to BMWs this is the best car by far. The volt technology provides great mileage the interior is the best I have owned. The truck offers good room while the backseat is tied is appointed with luxury.",
  "cadillac_elr_2016": " Quite simply having owned BMW's, Corvette's etc (I love these cars BTW)....The ELR is the greatest car ever.

As battery technology improves, it is conceivable ELR battery replacement will become available.  This is a car to keep... My 2016 Sport is fast, comfortable, provides great MPGe and is an overall thrill to drive all the time.  Cadillac has no idea about marketing and have made a huge mistake by ending its life.  I took it to a Cadillac event in NJ recently and everyone was incredibly impressed.  Every new Caddy should have a plug-in option and offer technology upgrades as they become available, similar to Tesla.  Also, the idiot auto bloggers and journalists haven't a clue when it comes to what people want.  It is not always about 0-100.  There is not 1 test on a 2016 ELR I can find.",

  "cadillac_elr_2016": " Having leased a 2014 Cadillac ELR (and 2011 Chevy Volt before it), the bar was already set very high.  Contrary to the comments of many online detractors, the ELR is -not- simply a dressed up Volt.  As any EV advocate should tell you, the fact that the Volt and ELR have the same powertrain configuration does not mean they are the same car.  That would be like arguing that any internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) is the same as any other because they both have similar engines and transmissions.  In an EV, what is a battery but the EV analog to an ICEV gas tank?  No one would argue two cars are the same because they have the same gas tank.  And the electric motor (be it in a Tesla, Leaf or Volt) is very similar in design from the original EV1 days, so it is more of a one size fits all part far more than the engine and transmission which need to be properly mated to the vehicle application.  Lastly, the ICE in the Volt and ELR are designed primarily to provide electricity rather than mechanical energy (although it does that too in limited circumstances).  What differentiates the Volt and ELR, then is the software and performance tuning (and the fact that the electric motor is more robust to handle the extra hp and torque).  The Volt and ELR provide vastly different driving experiences.  Other than the fact that both are silent,  you would never confuse driving one for the other.I had previously said that the 2014 ELR was the perfect electric personal luxury coupe.  It may not be as fast as a Model S, but it had plenty of torque.  Also, whereas the Model S is beautiful, practical, spacious sedan, the beauty of the ELR is that it is the opposite: it is designed to be a personal car first and foremost, not a family car.  It is not practical, nor is it intended to be.  The 2014 ELR was -exactly- what I wanted: a personal car that can transport my family in a pinch.  In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful expressions of automotive design in history, both inside and out.  I thought I could not be happier with the 2014 ELR...... until I drove the 2016 ELR.  Cadillac increased its performance, refined its handling, upgraded its CUE infotainment system with faster processing, more features, and enhanced the interface, and lowered the price.  I had to have it, so I managed to transfer my 2014 ELR lease, and leased a new one.  After having an ELR for 2 years, I still enjoy simply looking at it.  The new '16 ELR is the perfect expression of Cadillac's Art , Science design theme, and is an absolute joy to drive.  I cannot praise it enough.",
  "cadillac_elr_2016": " ELR is the future.Great two door commuter car or for the weekend. Inside comfort is nice.  I like the combo of touch screen and buttond.  Seats are very comfortable.I think a price of $60 k to $65 k is fair for this 2 door luxury futuristic coup.",
  "cadillac_escalade-esv_2016": " My husband and I have purchased brand new GM vehicles for many years now. Needles to say we have invested a great deal of money in our trucks and suvs. In 2015 we decided to purchase a 2016 Cadillac ESV because we liked the look of it. Well, not everything that glitters is gold, that's for sure!! Shortly after purchasing we started noticing the shifting was rough, the gears shift so rough all the passengers feel the rough shifting especially when taking off and on and off during a ride. The roughness of the shifting gets worse after time. As the problem with the shifting gets worse and worse the truck eventually won't even turn on, it just goes dead. We had to use cables to start it up so we could drive it to the agency and hope it would not leave us stranded. We expected so much more from a Cadillac vehicle being that our investment was a total of 94,000 dollars. The truck has been in the shop a total of six (6) times and it almost feels as if I've been driving a loaner more than my vehicle. Our family loves to take road trips in the summer months but we we have not been able to take summer road trips since we do not trust this truck to keep our family safe. We have no faith in Cadillac products and will never, EVER invest in Cadillac again!! We contacted GM to informed them of our concerns and expected GM to stand by their product but the best they could do was inform us that the shifting pattern is a new one with these new Cadillacs and the customers are not used to it. Whaaat??? No vehicle that we have ever driven shifts as rough and in such unpredictable patterns as this Cadillac ESV. Plus every time we get our vehicle back and new parts such as , gear box, are replaced and computer is reprogrammed it rides much better but eventually the problem starts once again until it gets so bad it eventually goes dead again! We will be trading this useless piece of JUNK for a real quality suv. Obviously GM does not care enough about their customers to keep them satisfied. Never Again!!",

Rattling noise in the rear end both sides is one of the biggest problem. I went to different dealerships from january 2016 till now(october 216) but no one able to find that noise exactly where its coming from instead they started changing all the parts out of my brand new escalade. They just assume that the noise is coming from here. They messed up my whole car with new parts and they didn't even find the problem.",

Ended up with motor of the Brand new engine stripped down to motor block in small town GM shop with parts laying all around to be fixed.  Asked Cadillac to exchange vehicle since I will never trust this engine and didn't not purchase used or refurbished and told warranty fixed it and that is all they will do.  So I spent all this money to have a dependable family vehicle thinking I had the best customer support since it was Cadillac.  I was wrong.",
  "cadillac_escalade-esv_2016": " This doesn't handle like your old Escalde. It handles mountain curves like never before. The well-sorted suspension and commanding view out make the vehicle seem to shrink when pressed hard. The magnetic shocks do a remarkable job of calming all but the worst rhythmic undulations. Fast, quiet, and comfortable. What more could you want out of a Cadillac?",
  "cadillac_escalade-esv_2016": " Having owned the 2007 ESV I thought long and hard about buying a new 2016.  Keeping in context we have owned Lexus since 1990, total of five LS models over the years. Best single auto manufacturer in the world for quality, value, cost of ownership.  Unless you need the size of the ESV for family, road travel, don't buy one.  Your hard earned $80K+ needs to go elsewhere because of the workmanship, quality issues.  It LOOKS awesome, rides great, it is the fitment, vibration, flutter of plastic parts rubbing against each other that will drive you crazy. The center CUE had a vibration as if a wiring harness had been flopping around. The sunroof decided just this morning that something up in there, needed to be jostling around, and these things happen only when they want to.  We have only owned her 3 weeks, she has 735 miles on her.  We got her for the room, size to accommodate family.  If LEXUS ever decides to make one similar in size, we are in.Nothing in my review changes except that I will never own another.  It is GM junk at the highest level.  Last May 22, 2016 we finally got help from the BBB in Washington DC to help replace the original 2016 we bought in Dec. 2015.  It took us 6 months to get rid of that pile of junk, replaced it with another pile of junk.  Folks other than the dealer experience being so stealor and supportive, I will never own another.  PERIOD.  From problems with transmissionn shifting at times I cant understand, to the dye color of the leather already wearing away.  Plastic parts look like wood and yet vibrate into a frenzy at times.  Listen carefully, you do what you want.  If you want to toss money into a pit loaded with stress and problems, then buy this thing.  If you want to save yourself the grief, buy Lexus or something else.",
  "cadillac_escalade_2016": " I owned a previous generation Escalade and the new model is a huge improvement over the old one.  Interior is very luxurious, and looks way better than GLS or Q7.  Old model was Rear or AWD only, and now you can get 4WD, and use it in rear wheel drive mode (or automatic or permanent 4WD) for everyday driving.  No need to use 4WD for summer driving and waste gas.   As a result fuel economy improved substantially, I get 16 mpg in the city and up to 26 mpg highway.  Apple CarPlay adds a nice touch and all electronics and navigation look/work perfectly fine.  My complaints would be lack of a sunroof in the base trim ($76K), and even if you get a model with a sunroof, it's a small one.  Panoramic roof is not available. Magnetic ride is awesome and very smooth, however, once you hit a rough pavement, the ride becomes very jittery. Handling is very confident and acceleration is very good, but, try to change lanes quickly at highway speeds, and you will be quickly reminded that you drive a huge truck. Overall driving feeling is very confident, you won't be bothered by snow, heavy rain or any other nonsense. In the end, I decided to get this car for its unique look and presence.  Park it next to Audi Q7 or MB GLS and see for yourself.  Q7 looks like a station wagon/minivan from the side, and GLS looks very unassuming and small next to the Escalade's huge grill and glowing vertical LED lights.  Euro competition may offer better ride and some technical advances, but Escalade brings such unique and unrivaled presence - it is still the king of SUVs.",
  "cadillac_escalade_2016": " I traded in a 2008 Lincoln Navigator for the 2016 Escalade. I love the styling and the technology, but that is about it. Comparing the 2016 Escalade and an 8 year old Navigator, the ride in the Navigator was superior. In addition I think the driver's  seat in the Escalade is probably the most uncomfortable car seat I have ever sat in. For almost $90,000 I was expecting a lot more comfort.",
  "cadillac_escalade_2016": " This is our third Escalade  to own.  I couldn't be more disappointed in the quality of the car this time.  They really cut corners in the interior and it shows  from parts coming unglued to the interior leather peeling.  On the outside of the car the Crome trim on the door popped off and all four doors trim work between the doors had to be replaced. My car had less than 8k miles and they replaced the transmission.  For a vehicle costing almost 100k very disappointed Cadillac. This will be our last.",
  "cadillac_escalade_2016": " I love mine.",
  "cadillac_escalade_2016": " The Escalade is a luxury truck in my opinion even the huge column gear shifter reminds me of a Chevy Truck.  Despite the plush seats and upscale interior, the ride has many jitters from road bumps, engine drones, and the transmission drones under acceleration. If you have ever owned a truck then you know what I mean.  If you are transitioning from European vehicles you will not like this unrefined beast in many aspects.  Despite the unrefined integration of all its bells and whistles, the Escalade makes a strong presence with its huge size, powerful engine, big LED taillights and headlights.  Maneuvering into a normal parking spot can be a challenge, especially in an indoor garage.  The front, rear, and top down view cameras do help with parking.  I love the feature that vibrates your seat to warn you before you back into an obstacle.   Road handling is its strength. This beast can handle every road condition because it is really a truck.  But riding in a truck with plush seats and interiors still can't trick your senses into believing that you are not in a truck.  The high pressure suspension doesn't have very good rebound damping.   When the suspension jitters are triggered, it resonates throughout the car.  It doesn't give you a muted and dampened ride that you get from an Audi Q7 or Mercedes GL.The GPS and radio has a nice big screen but it is tilted in a strange angle. The buttons are intuitive but again not refined like European or Japanese entertainment systems.  Also, I wished the GPS map has a way of displaying on the large LCD dash display while the car is in motion.  The Escalade only lets you see small arrows and turn instructions on the dash and on the minimalist HUD display.  The audio system has clear sounds, and the interior is quiet enough even when blasting down the freeway at 80mph, as long as the road is smooth and you don't trigger the suspension jitter from poor road conditions.  I also like the air vented and massaging seat.  The lane departure control that vibrates your seat as a warning is a nice touch.  Having owned a Z06 Vette, and now got a chance to experience the Escalade, my complaints about high-end GM products are the same, un-refined interior.  Unless you need the SIZE of the Escalade, an European SUV is much nicer to live with.",

This vehicle is nothing short of amazing. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would get a back massage while cruising at 75 mph down the interstate.  We are still discovering the latest gadgets and taking it in tomorrow to have upgraded software installed to integrate our phones for easier applications of usage. Another plus, we got an astounding average of 26mpg at 70 mph last weekend on a road trip.  The down side is that the apative cruse control would go offline going down the highway due to an error in the system. That is going to be addressed tomorrow also.

  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " Over the years I've had very good luck and have been satisfied with several vehicles in the GM family...(Yukon, C5 Corvette, 2014 Stingray and two SRXs).  My previous vehicles operationed beautifully and I was often very happy with the driving exprience.  Given my good luck with GM, I decided to jump into the XT5 (FWD Premium Luxury Package).  The styling is terrific and the car is comfortble.  However, the instrument cluster is a recycled dash of the previous SRX but with illumination that is way too dim for day light driving.  The result is a dull, lackluster display not befitting a luxury flagship vehicle.  The Auto/Stop function is downright annoying and possibly even dangerous in heavy stop and go traffic.  With the vehicle shutting off / stalling all the time it gives the driver a very uneasy feeling when you need sudden acceleration, such as in making sudden turn in an intersection.  GM HAS to disable and or allow the driver to opt out of this feature.  Now, with only two weeks of owning my XT5, the entire Cue system has gone haywire and is blacking out and turning on and off at will.  Buyers remorse is an understatement. This flagship line of GM has been struggling for better market share and without a little more thought, time and real world testing, the XT5 and Cadillac for that matter will find itself lagging behind the completion and may fail all together.   Seek out other vehicle options or stick with the SRX until GM sorts out the bugs and design issues.",

Seems like the reviewers were of two minds on this SUV - either they thought it was a rough ride that was not very sound proofed or a smooth ride that is very quiet. Some complained about the CUE system. I find the car to be a very smooth ride and quieter than my Lexus RX350. The CUE system is much more user friendly than the systems in the BMW and Mercedes to me. Neither of them have a touch screen. Using a mouse/touchpad and trying to maneuver it while keeping your eyes on the road is not user friendly as far as I am concerned. There is a bit of a learning curve, but certainly nothing like the other systems.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " I took my SRX in for warranty work and was given the XT5 AWD as a loaner for one day.  Here is my thoughts based on the 55 miles I put on it. The XT5 is similar to my 4-month-old SRX in terms of pricing and trim level. However, the XT5 is very different in the following ways. Engine: newer engine with auto-start-stop function and a newer transmission.  Secondly, I noticed right away that the led lights are standard and the headlights are not halogen like the similar trim SRX. The XT5 does have the auto start/stop where the engine could be automatically turned off at a red light (by the software). When you step on the gas pedal, the engines turns back on. The car, also, switches between V6 and V4 mode depending on the power needs, similar to Honda's VCM technology. The ride is quiet, smooth, and sure-footed. However, I did feel that the SRX's engine delivers quick power when demanded while the XT5's engine has to figure out how much power the driver needs before delivering it.  So there is a brief lag time since the software has to decide between different modes (V6 vs V4) to deliver power. On the positive note, the XT5 is very fuel efficient compared to the SRX. The nagging windspeed noise originating from the panoramic roof on the SRX seems to have been resolved. The placement of several buttons on the SRX, such as parking brake or Onstar, have been moved around. So there will be a learning curve for the SRX drivers when they upgrade to the XT5. Most importantly, several ",

The problem that we have is NOT  with the people in the dealership or with the customer service, it is with the product you have and the system you have to check the technical problems.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " An outstanding revision of the SRX. Cadillac got this one right",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " We have been driving Cadillacs since 1990 and always enjoyed them very much. Our first bucket seats were in our 2002 4 door sedan. We are older folks and have never enjoyed the Cadillac bucket seats. We had a 2013 DTS and those seats did not fit our needs very well. We had to purchase kitchen chair pads from Walmart to get us out of the hole we were in with the vehicle. When we got our 2017 XT5 we thought maybe the seats might be better, nope the same old seats. A friend suggested we visit a Relax The Back store and look at one of their seat units. We did and bought one for our new car. We drove the car from Minn. to Arizona and found the new seat worked just great. When we arrived in Arizona we went right out to a store and bought another unit for the rider seat. This is the first SUV we have ever owned, we have to say we enjoy it very much. It's so much easier to get in and out of this style vehicle. The good news, no more hitting of my head when I get into this car.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " I was not sure about this SUV initially. Did some research before buying. I never owned a Cadillac before and has always owned a Lexus. I was planning to buy a new Van/SUV for my wife as her Toyota Sienna has done 68000 miles on it. Even though the Sienna is a great van, I did not like the fact that AWD has the Run Flat Tires on them, which gives it a bumpy ride and is expensive replacing the tires as it cannot be repaired otherwise it was a great family vehicle for us. My son has been learning to drive and it was also did not look good for him as he was driving a family van. Since my Sienna was well maintained, I good a good appraisal for it, so we decided to buy new car. Initially we saw Pacifica, which my wife did not like - quality of the vehicle was in question. Then we took a test drive in Cadillac xt5, Very good ride, excellent quality overall. People talk about the Cue not being fast enough, I think the Cue is much better than the system in my 2014 MB ML350. I also noted that the xt5 does not have a CD player - which i don't mind as we never use CDs anymore, as we have learned to use USBs/SD cards. The vehicle has 2 USB port in the front console and 2 for the back seats, I would have expected Cadillac to have SD card reader installed - but not a big deal. The other issue is the cargo space, it could have been little bit bigger, the head clearance for back seat is 2 inches short when compared to Lexus RX - hope Cadillac brings an SUV with little bit more space for the back passengers and cargo. There is no other choice, either you go for xt5, or Escalade which is huge. Over all very happy. Have to wait and see how it holds up to its reputation.         The above was my earlier review. Currently my SUV is with the dealer with complete black out of CUE system. Why driving the CUE system completely went dead and an error message saying ",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " We waited to get the XT5 because of review promises that the CUE system would be greatly improved.  After 12,000 miles, I would say CUE is still crap.   A huge problem is that the touch screen requires far too many submenus to achieve even simple commands.  The navigation system relies on out-dated maps which reflected incorrect speeds easily half the time on our 40 state trip.  It got lost about once every thousand miles on interstate segments that had been changed at least 2 years earlier.  It had no detour option and will not reroute even after driving 50 miles on a different highway! Traffic warnings were unreliable.  Fortunately if you have a mobile phone supporting Android Auto (AA), that functions like you would expect a luxury car nav system to function.  AA understands my Bulgarian spouses accent every time.  When driving, handling is fantastic.  This car and turn inside many sedans with a far shorter radius than our SRX.  Pickup is quite peppy.  Mileage is very good for a car of this class.  The gearshift is counter intuitive, and the transmission sometime hunts for the right gear in stop-n-go traffic.  The fit and finish is good, cargo space excellent, and it has lots of nice feature like ample door storage.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " I think that I am having troubles with the start/stop feature since the car has not turned off in almost 3 weeks and about 1000 miles of driving. I contacted the service dept. at the dealer about 2 weeks ago and the service adviser didn't even seem to know that the XT5 had a no-turn- off start/stop system so he told me to just keep driving. I then called the salesman who told me to drive the car until the weather cooled down to see if it would turn off on its own. Today I visited the dealer's service department to make sure that I was not injuring the cat since it does seem to try to turn off at the same intersections that it used to. Today's service adviser printed off reasons that the system does not work and they are the same reasons that I saw long ago on the internet or in the manual. He told me to just drive the car normally and that I would get a warning from the car if something was wrong.  He also assured me that there are many XT5's out here and that none has reported a start/stop problem, although he did not bother to check my car.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " I upgraded from a Honda CRV (which was great).  However, in this car I feel like a queen.  I really like the safety features that tell me that a car or pedestrian is approaching and from where.  When there is a danger, the driver seat vibrates that alerts you to look at instruments to see what the problem is.  I was disappointed that there is no CD player.  CDs may be on the way out, but most of us still have favorite CDs.  It would be nice to be able to use them.  Also, I was disappointed that no spare tire (unless it is purchased as an addition) or donut was provided.  I only received a can of ",

Engine is great with plenty of power fit and finish is perfect.  I was a little disappointed that Cadillac trimmed a few options from the luxury model I purchased before like:  no cd player, sill plates no longer have a light in them, there is no longer a horizontal interior dash trim  light, tan interior no longer offered in tan headliner with tan carpet only in black. Front seats need a little more attention to front bottom bolsters, (need more padding).  Except for the dashboard the whole interior seemed a little cheaper..  I do not like the steering wheel option of leather wrapped heated the 2010 Luxury model had a wood/leather steering wheel I liked more.I have to save the car drives great,  seems to be quieter, same gas millage even though it has a bigger engine,  Bose system sounds great, (I hate it has no built in cd),",

Mind you I bought the base model and it's fully loaded.  The Luxury has a sun roof and a lot of safety features but I felt the base model came with SO MUCH that it was perfect, and it is.  Great fuel economy ( Don't love the  stop feature when you are at a stoplight but it's becoming a lot more common, I get it)   Living in Florida, A/C is important and this system delivers in spades.  Love hat we can remotely start the car and cool it off first.  Sound system is insane!  Inclusion of apple car play is seemless.

I don't drive a midsize SUV daily but found I enjoyed this experience. As a body shop owner I have the opportunity to drive most brands and found this to be one of the most engaging rides in its class.

While driving with my sunroof completely open, for some reason it does something to your ears. it feels as if pressure is in your ears. somewhat like flying on an airplane. I thought it was me, but I allowed three friends to drive the car, and they experienced the same feeling. The only way to eliminate the problem is to open a side window.

  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " Test Drive the Lexus GX 460 , BMW X3 SUV and the decision will be easy. The XT5 checks all of the Boxes.

  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " When someone starts gives you how big a seat is in inches, I kind of figure they're a competitor and not an owner. I've owned more than a few SUV's in my including the RX (3), Audi (1), a Highlander, an Infiniti and1 other American SUV besides a Caddy. Had a SRX which quite frankly I didn't care for. I now own an XT5 and it is a great car. Transmission is 8 speed so it's moving through gears nicely. Blue tooth hookup and what I like is if the phone rings, the A/C gets quieter automatically. I like that there are now more buttons and less of that touch screen. I hated pushing the screen to increase the A/C. Now it's a button. The rear view camera can be used as your rear view mirror so if there are people in the back seat, your view will not be blocked. I'm 6 foot but not overweight so I find the seats very comfortable. My legs haven't fallen asleep while driving. All in all, I'm happy with this SUV and I believe it compares favorably with the RX.",
  "cadillac_xt5_2017": " This is a second shot at a review after 2000 miles and a fairly long trip of all day driving. First of all. The acceleration is wonderful. The handing is not Lazy boy Cadillac, it's sporty handling corners like a sporty SUV which I guess it is from the performance. Love the handling. Love the silence on the road. I have residual hearing problems from big guns in the military and even with my dodgy hearing I can easily hear my music and audio books on trips, not to mention the helpful musings of my spouse. Braking is excellent if not a tad touchy. You do not have to stomp on these brakes. I love the safety features like lane change warnings, rear crossing warnings and the back up camera although I have never got the need for the digital track in the rear camera to bend its my turning. I know I'm turning. I am very gratified that an American company is making a car of this apparent quality. It gives nothing to the off shore imports. This car is a stand out in a city where you can't swing a dead possum without hitting a BMW and Mercedes. It seems to be some kind of cultural imperative but I've had my share of complements even though I doubt many people look carefully enough to distinguish it from a SRX. The overall appearance of the exterior and mechanicals is stunning and the color I selected, Silver Coast is a stealth car wash avoidance feature. It hides the dirt wonderfully when I am negligent on washing the car.  one last small gripe. I don't like the design of the 18 inch wheels. Kind of seventies looking. Cadillac could do better. Look on the web to get some ideas. My single annoyance with this part of the car and it is a BIG one, is the inability to turn off the stop/start mechanism. You can off foot it and you get lurches. It is not as clever as the propeller hat engineers who designed it think it is. I hate it and would not buy the car again. I can find just about any other car that allows you to disable this dubious feature including other Cadillac models. It works off the brake and you can fool it. If you are at a signal and the engine turns off, just lift your foot off the brake and it will start again. Depressing the brake again while you are waiting will not shut it off a second time. I am not thrilled with the XT two step.  I want to get this all praise out because I think this is a Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hide car. Mr Hide designed the interior. The dash lights adjust automatically and are too dim in day light for me. I can not manually adjust them higher. They brighten in a parking structure and at night and you can dim them down with the dimmer switch but that switch does nothing to brighten the dash lights in the day. This forces me to use the window with a large numeral for speed determination. This is a problem because of the propensity for the dash to reflect overhead sun at certain times of the day. In fact, same said genius engineer also probably designed the center information center with insufficient shading and helpfully tilted the screen toward to windshield at the top just to make sure that you don't miss getting the screen compromised by the sun reflection.  You can play CSI and count your finger prints on it for lack of seeing other information. The seat is my biggest interior problem. My wife's RX350 has wonderful seats. She is looking for a new car and ruled out the XT5 because of the hard seats and the uncomfortable lumbar support. I have the same complaint. Hard seating not good for long drives. bothers my leg. I had to get a piece of memory foam which my spouse sewed up in a cover to put on the seat. This is a sport seat and not suitable for a SUV in my opinion. All the SUVs I have ridden in and owned have had more comfortable seats. Again. Live with this car before you buy. Rent one and see if the seat suits your back side. I hate them which makes it awkward for a car I now own.  As I said, I am tall and large. When I sit with the seat back, it is obvious they thought to put in a long seat track for tall people but then failed to accommodate any other interior feature to this seating position. The center console is difficult if not nearly impossible to get into. The dash information center is way too far away. The door panels bow out near the front of the car then conveniently bow back in to crowd your arm. Another thing that escapes me is the logic of the seat memory. In any other car you press the memory button and number one for example to set your seat and in the future you just tap the button to make the seat move. In the XT, you have to lean on the button for the entire trip and if you stop pressing, the seat stops moving. To have the seat work automatically you have to turn on a feature in settings. After you do that the car resists any further changes. You have to turn it off to reset memory. In my case that is far too frequently because the seat does not seem to hold the back rest angle and must be readjusted periodically. Brilliant outside, not inside.",

The ride is better, Cadillac has always had that baby buggy ride much softer than the Lincoln. XT5 electric power is the best very smooth with a short turning radius. Possibly one of the best new feathers is the new eight speed automatic transmissionSmooth as glass, at eighty miles per hour tach is reading 1950 RPM about 200 less than the Lincoln MKX.

This XT5 is simply amazing for the value and the money compared to the Germans and Japanese brands.  I have beeb leary about American cars ever since the bailout but tried them out again.  Glad I did...  Without rambling, and after driving all those other vehicles, Caddy was the winner , hands down.    Handling , front, side and rear view amazing, quietness, power, etc were all as good as it gets in my opinion.  I am not a brand loyal person as you can see but I would recommend anyone looking in this category to give the XT5 a good look.My ONLY picky complaint in the piano black entertainment system panel.   It is a fingerprint magnet.   Told you I was picky.   If anyone has anyone particular questions , you can always ask.I will be really anxious to see what the National Crash Tests look like once tested.   So far, I am thrilled with my decision",

After five months and 6000 miles it is sitting in my garage unused waiting to be traded in at a major loss. Serious maintenance problems include a complete loss of power overnight while sitting in the garage. Roadside service had problems starting it with his power pack and finally had to jump start it with an old personal truck that he used. The dealer service department could not find a fault after keeping the car overnight to trace the battery drain. A  few days later while on a local drive, the transmission failed! It would not move forward or reverse. The beautiful car sat on the side of the road until road service showed up to tow it to the dealership. The dealer determined parts were needed to repair it and it took almost a week to get it repaired. The transmission is now shifting rough but dealer test shows no fault. Being an elderly owner, I have lost all confidence in the vehicle and do not dare drive it on long trips. I am now using my wife's reliable Honda CRV for long trips.

We first drove the new CT5 and really liked it, but the ride was nothing compared to the xts which we drove afterwards. Got the base model in black with black interior and dark tinted windows, it looks like the top of the line model but for much less. She drives like a dream, like floating on a magic carpet...but also handles surprisingly well for such a large car. It has tons of high tech stuff that I could care less about, but it does look nice. The other thing is very few peeps have one where I live, so its something different and special as well. Ginormous interior, but drives like a smaller car....silky smooth and I get compliments everywhere I go. And since most peeps are buying suv/cuvs now, sedans have much larger rebates...the xts is no different, with the gm card...giant gm rebates and dealer discounts, I bought this beauty for less then you could buy a new bmw 320i for...the xts is much nicer, larger, more powerful...getting 30mpg on the highway as well...only downside is slightly restricted side and rear view, put a couple of those stick on convex mirrors and your good to go!  I feel like a rock star driving it and Highly recommended!",
  "cadillac_xts_2017": " I rented this vehicle for 12 days in San Diego over the holidays.  In spite of reading the manual twice and calling Onstar (they were no help), I could not figure out even the most basic commands like getting the seat memories to stick or getting the trip meter to appear on the display.  Even more infuriating: most of the time when exiting the car, the driver's seat would move back and the outside mirrors would point towards the ground.  While I appreciate the car's attempt to ease egress and spot puddles, the problem is the seat and mirrors would not return to their previous position when getting back in the car!  It's really aggravating having to reset these items every time you go somewhere.  My opinion is CUE is a disaster.  It was easy pairing my phone, however.  Additionally, the XTS now has rubberband 19 tires that ride like crap!  I could feel every little imperfection on San Diego's crappy side streets.  On the plus side, the car's handling was quite good.  The XTS is  a blast to throw around corners, although I miss the sound of a V8 and the car could definitely use 50 more lbs. feet of torque.  Overall, I dropped this car off thinking Cadillac doesn't know what the cars mission is and who their customers are.   I do know I could never spend $55K on a car who's controls can't be figured out, with a ride that my Ram 1500 puts to shame!",

  "chevrolet_bolt-ev_2017": " I'm assuming I have one of the early ones with a mfg date of 11/2016.  I have a long commute so the range is perfect for me.  With the long freeway commute, I have noticed that this car requires a lot more steering input than I would like to stay straight on the freeway.  Compared to a Prius C, which practically feels like it doesn't have power steering at speed (a good thing).  My wife drives a Leaf and this car outdoes it in every way except for the rear cargo space.  The Bolt is 11 inches shorter than the Leaf and it's noticeable only in the trunk space.  All other dimensions are very similar.  Glad to see a flat rear floor on the Bolt vs the center battery hump in the Leaf, so this car easily seats 5.  Being a shorter car with a shorter wheelbase, I'm confused as to why the turn radius is 6 inches wider than with the Leaf.  Front visibility is better than with the Leaf, in which the Leaf A pillars consistently block my view of pedestrians waiting to cross the street at stop signs.  Strange thing with my specific car:  Somewhere between final QC at the factory and when I bought the car (with 10 miles on it, so it could have been the last person who test drove it?), the video feed coax cable to the digital rear view mirror got ripped right off, rendering it inoperable (and un-fixable).  It was the one of a handful of features I didn't try before I signed all the papers (of course).  Been waiting a week after my first visit to the service department and the new mirror hasn't arrived yet from the factory. Power is adequate.  The manual is non-specific in a few things like the fact that a pump and sealant kit does not come with this car because it has the self sealing tires, though the manual has clear instructions on how to use the pump/sealant ",
  "chevrolet_bolt-ev_2017": " I used to drive a Nissan Leaf and I would always say that it was the best car that I've ever owned but the Bolt has taken that title. The car has a European sports car feel to it when you drive. Taut and feel everything ride. It's a big change from the Leaf but I like this ride.",

  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " Before you buy this car, know that you are not getting good gas mileage, know that you are not getting any passengers of any size in and out of the backseat easily, know that everything maintenance wise is potentially costly. With that out of the way I love my Camaro, I was semi prepared for all the drawbacks of owning this vehicle, but I would still buy it knowing all the drawbacks. I have a 6 speed manual, and it has GM's skip shift technology which makes you shift from 1st to 4th when you take off traveling less than 21 MPH (to save gas). I try to go faster than that because I don't like skip shift and there is no way (yet) to disable it. There is a blind spot due to the design of the car, but with the lane change assist in the side view mirrors and the backup camera that about makes up for it. This car moves when you hit the gas, it sounds mean and commands respek (yes I know I spelled that wrong). I feel like a whole different person while driving my Camaro, I become one with the car. I got an awesome deal when I bought it as it was the end of the month and only one 2016 left on the lot, they offered that one at 20% off. I jumped on that because I was only looking for a 1SS so I got the 2SS for less. I plan to keep this car forever, my 14 year old son is hoping he will be driving it in two years when he's old enough, I don't know we'll see, but yeah this is the best car purchase for me in my 43 years.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " The 2SS is a fantastic build.  The automatic with the paddle shifters is awesome. I can drive in any traffic with one hand.  And no worries with the 8 speed - it responds instantly to the throttle while my left leg and and an arm lounge in freedom.  The leather seats, dash and door trims are very comfortable and adjustable. Front leg and shoulder room is great. the sun roof is perfect and allows the perfect amount of light and openness to the compartment even when closed. The back seat space increases the comfort, air and openness of the interior compartment  space, has acoustic advantages, and creates the extra needed storage available from the interior of the vehicle. This car responds to all of my inputs whether that be  to and fro.  This one is built at the Cadillac factory and there is not a loose bone on it. Caution though - While this car is built extremely well for driving and cornering at a range of all speeds you might be tempted to anger authorities. So be careful when you use the *Launch Control*. Perhaps Cape Canaveral would be an appropriate location.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " The Camaro goes way beyond pony car - the 2SS package is a factory race car without a doubt! With Track and Competitive Driving Mode this truly is ready to hit the track, yet putt around town with the wife or take a cruise on the highway and one quickly notices this race car has some very fine manners indeed! The technology is astounding! Hop in and crank it up and your bluetooth automatically connects and starts playing music right where it left off. 6'7",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " This was a special ordered 2-SS Convertible that wasn't even manufactured until April 2016 in Lansing.  I have had a 1969 , 1973 Z-28 Camaro, 1971 , 74 'vette but this car with the magnetic ride, LT1 Corvette Engine in nothing but FUN to drive.  This is the most responsive factory made car I have ever had the pleasure of driving.  Regardless of speed form 27 to 127, when you ask it to move faster - it does without hesitation.  Having the 4 handling settings allow you to tour down the road with an amazing 28.5 MPG at 65 MPH, or in Sport mode make on lookers snap their necks to see it.  This model year did not offer either the Z-28 , ZL1 options so they really piled on the extras with the 2SS models.  I waited for Chevy to put the new Convertible top on this model and it was well worth the wait.  You can drive up to 35 MPH and easily open or close the top.  After driving a 2015 and 2015 convertible, this is by every means superior top in every way, even noise. I dubbed this my retirement car, but never knew I would love driving near as much as I do and I only have 2,500 miles, can't wait to add more.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " The complaint about rear visibility is true. As far as any sports car enthusiast is concerned, or any real driver for that matter, it doesn't matter. After only a few times of driving this car you will figure it out. It requires you to drive the car, really. And that is exactly why you would buy this car. The Gen 6 Camaro is the new Corvette, it's that good. When Corvette begins to produce the Zora in 2018, this will be the car that takes its place. This car is so much fun and has so much power for a stock sports car, it should probably be illegal. God bless America. Be sure you get a good radar detector when you purchase this car. You are going to need it. I now have 10,000 miles on mine, because I bought it to drive it. I simply can't stop driving it. It's not my daily driver, so I can hardly wait for the weekend. Everyone, and I mean everyone who sees it or hears it falls immediately in love with the car. The only thing I don't like about the car is the decals used for the stripes. Even my wife who doesn't really appreciate sports cars normally loves this car. Enough said.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I bought a 2LT conv with 3.6 V6. I can't review the 4 cylinder or the V8. Took car to Phoenix Az with 80 miles on clock. 4900 mile round trip. averaged 27.3 mpg at average speed of 69 mph. that includes about 300 miles of city driving, stop and go and cruising at from 75 mph to 90 mph. Averaged over 30 mpg in mountains of Az and N Mexico. Very comfortable for 12 hour driving days. Preferred it to my Mercedes CLS63 or Audi A5 for the trip.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I bought a new 2016 Camaro with the I4 turbo engine. Great power for a 4 cyl. Only problem I have is the constant cluck in front end driving over cracks in the road. GM needs to refine this. Sounds like a cheap import. Test drove a mustang and they don't have that noise in their suspension.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I acquired about a camaro 2SS through email and Donna Lee from Chevy Phillips in lansing, il was there every step of the way. She was delight to work with when I got to the dealership and I couldn't ask for a better salesman. This is my second car purchase this year from Donna and she will always be my go to person. Always a pleasure. The V8 is the engine to get. the rumble from the car when you start it up will put a smile on your face. It drives effortless pass other vehicles. It lighter and hugs the road and the car is built solid and tight. I am never the person to worry about a backseat in a sport car. If I'm driving I'm not worry about who in back seat they need to get there own if they can't fit :)",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " Great gas mileage for a Camaro but have to decide if it's worth the trade off with the V6 for price, but very satisfied with the 4cyl Turbo.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I had a manual 2008 C6 and was looking for a more comfortable daily driver. I test drove it and fell in love with the ride (mine has magnetic ride control), interior design and quality and performance. I bought a 2SS with Auto because I drive it in traffic. I recommend it.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " This is a driver's car. The motor is intoxicating - both in power and sound. It is the most performance for the money that one can buy at the moment. Unlike the muscle cars of a bygone era, the 2016 Camaro SS handles as well as it accelerates, which is high praise, indeed. The interior is comfortable and well-appointed.  Plenty of legroom, but if you are tall, you may want the sunroof, as merely having it means increased headroom in the car. The controls fall easily to hand. Magnetic ride and the adjustable exhaust are the way to go. Change from soft(ish) suspension and a quiet exhaust (Touring mode) to a more throaty exhaust and stiffer damping at the touch of a button. Set the ride to meet your mood or the conditions. Much has been made of visibility out of the cockpit. While no one is going to give the car a ",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " It is a great car but make sure you get the rear view and lane alarm systems.  The windows are small and vision is limited due to the windows.The car makes you feel like you are driving a fighter jet.  The Apple Play and nav system are great.  The displays are awesome and you can customize them. I got the RS package and the 8 speed automatic.  I have had it for a week and I am really enjoying it.  This is my first Chevrolet purchase.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " Great car that's fun to drive. Performance and options match or outperform that of European sports cars double the price. Don't buy from Autonation Pembroke Pines Chevrolet. The manager there was unpleasant and seemed dishonest. Their service center is really very disappointing also.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " It is great to finally have a US based company producing an honest to goodness sports couple with fantastic performance at a relatively modest $40k-ish price point.   This car is just a pure joy to drive daily.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " It exceedes my expectations...I could sleep in it...ive had a jaguar xj8 sport before and a bmw 525 and you just can't compare the feeling I get when I sit in the camaro .. best feeling ive ever had with a car.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " Do your research on the camaro forums.  Find a good dealer. Know what you want in options. Buy it .",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I love being in this car...driving this car... everything about it is cool. I don't know how well it will hold up over the long run as it's a new car with a new design --even a new engine (corvette engine now in the camaro). Fingers crossed. The gas mileage isn't great, but with 455 hp, what could you expect. I'm averaging 23.5 mpg and getting about 420 miles on a tank of gas.  Drove it from North Carolina to S. Florida and up and down the florida interstate every day since for work. It's a blast.I love the sound system too.The tech is a bit glitchy, but I'm figuring it out. Same as with any new iPhone or some such thing. Not particularly troubling.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " I was very hesitant in purchasing the new 2016 V6 Camaro and opted to go with essentially the base model because this is my fiancxc3xa9s and I's secondary car so we didn't need all the bells and whistles. I had been looking at the R/T Challenger which was about $10k more, and while it definitely sounded meaner, it was not worth it to me personally. The Camaro has been such a great purchase so far, I have gotten so many compliments on the new styling and the sound of the engine while driving. Its 0-60 in 5.9 seconds which to me is more than enough speed(335 HP). I will update in a year after I see if the quality of the car holds up. The visibility is definitely something I had to get used to (coming from our other car which is a '16 ford fusion that has pretty decent visibility) but I added blind spot mirrors and use the rearview camera often and I have gotten the hang of the visibility of the car. I am looking forward to taking this to California for family visits to see how it handles through the mountains. Also the car may seem small inside but I had a friend get in who was about 6'3 and he told me he was more than comfortable in the car so don't let the interior size put you off.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " First off before the fanboi's go on the attack, yes, I understand it's a first year car. But it's not the fist time GM has bought or built seats, headliners, transmissions etc. Can't blame ",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " Since purchasing this car a month ago, I haven't stopped smiling. I ordered the vehicle in November and although I was discouraged by the 3 month+ wait time for the build, it was so worth it. The styling of this car is amazing, the quality in comparison to the gen5 cars is on an entirely different level. The 2SS is everything I could ask for, the 6.2L is incredible and doesn't stop pulling, can't wait for break-in period to be over....",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2016": " We have owned the car about a month and it is a very fast car, we also own the new Mustang 5.0 with the performance package and they are very different rides.  The Camaro, while luxurious still feels ferocious, the Mustang is smoother and a little tame.  The technology in the Camaro is way better than the Mustang, it seems GM look over the Mustang and made everything better.",

  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " Edmunds does not have a catagory for a V6 engine, only the turbo 4 or the V8. I have the Camaro 1LT V6 automatic. I always bought V8 muscle cars over the years, but this V6 has plenty of power and sounds great with the performance exhaust option. Ride comfort is good, the seats are really comfortable (I'm 6'3",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " First let me explain - I have a 2017 Camaro RS 2LT V6 with Automatic - 50th Anniversary Edition. I was not given this choice by Edmunds!  It is a great car. This is the third and so far the best Camaro I have owned. The ride is smooth and acceleration is wonderful. It is extremely comfortable and fun to drive (fast). FYI - I got the V6 engine because it takes regular gas not premium like the 4 Cylinder Turbo and the V8.",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " I will not let anyone ride in the rear seats due to the lack of headrests. What is GM thinking?",

  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " I traded a 2006 G35 6mt coupe for my 2017 Camaro. It performs well considering the skepticism on the 4cyl turbo vs the V6 and V8. I had $4k in mods on my old car and the new one still out performs it. Ive found the turbo upgrades for later that will get the car to 390hp over 400 ftlbs of torque the kit runs $2700. I'm looking forward to owning this car. On board wifi, 3 ecu modes for driving, the display and all I'm loving it!",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " in 2012 i was looking into a mustang and chose a camaro because of the knee room the camaro has and lack of in the mustang. so when it came time to buy new, i went to view the camaro.

Unfortunately i HAD to pass on buying this car thus causing my dream of owning 2 anniversary models to fade. oh well",
  "chevrolet_camaro_2017": " I got a 2017 Camaro 2.4 l turbo It was advertised for $27,000-$30,000 and the total cost ended up being $54,000 with the Gaff insurance also. Its a very nice car but $54,000 is pretty steep. Also, Its not very good on gas mileage either. The dealer at Sands Chevrolet weren't that knowledgeable about the car either. They just saw SUCKER! on my head, and also as advertised my payments should have been $399 - $400 a month with excellent credit , but instead they are $700 a month. I am going to get it refinanced this week.  $700 a month, I could have gotten a Mercedes instead, But over all I love it. The gas mileage in the city on Tour selection instead of sport selection is showing 17.2 MPG and not 21 like they advertised.",
